Analyzing YouTube Data
In this assignment, you will write a Python script to download user interaction data from YouTube for each
“youtubeId” provided in the “vdoLinks.csv” file. For each of the YouTube video id, you will extract the
following information:
1. 100 comments
2. Description of the video
3. View Count
4. Like Count
5. Dislike Count
6. Comment Count
7. Duration of the video
8. Favorite Count
While extracting the data, if any of the “youtubeId” does not work, please ignore that ID and proceed with
the following “youtubeId”.
After the data extraction is done, then please find out the following:
1. A list of the top-10 videos based on the total views
2. A list of the bottom-10 videos based on the total views
3. The most liked video
4. The least liked video
5. The video with the highest duration
6. Apply sentiment analysis on the downloaded comments for each of the videos. For sentiment
analysis, you can use VADER or any other tool of your choice. Your program should list the
sentiments score for each of the movies
Data from YouTube can be extracted in many ways. You can use any of the available approaches. However,
we have practiced one method for the task in our Lab session that might be handy.
