1,Grumpier Old Men (1995),"The more things change, the more they stay the same in Wabasha, Minnesota. The uncatchable fish named Catfish Hunter grows fatter. The wisecracks, zingers and put downs pile up like freshly raked leaves. And GRUMPY OLD MEN become grumpier in the sequel that's ""pure delight, a wonderfully warmhearted comedy"" (David Sheehan, CBS-TV). Grabbing fishing rods and picking up where they left off, JACK LEMMON and WALTER MATTHAU reel in another comedy winner as GRUMPIER OLD MEN. ANN-MARGRET, DARYL HANNAH, KEVIN POLLACK and BURGESS MEREDITH also return to the Land of 10,000 Lakes to reprise their roles. And SOPHIA LOREN is the newcomer whose plan to turn the town's beloved bait shop into a ristorante sends the old boys into a tizzy. Be advised: a tizzy is very contagious. Get ready to laugh.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Sam Rothstein (Robert De Niro) fights his old friend Nicky (Joe Pesci) and his wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) for control of his Las Vegas empire.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The inner-workings of a corrupt Las Vegas casino are exposed in Martin Scorsese's story of crime and punishment. The film chronicles the lives and times of three characters: ""Ace"" Rothstein (Robert De Niro), a bookmaking wizard; Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci), a Mafia underboss and longtime best friend to Ace; and Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone, in a role she was born to play), a leggy ex-prostitute with a fondness for jewelry and a penchant for playing the field. Ace plays by the rules (albeit Vegas rules, which, as he reminds the audience in voiceover, would make him a criminal in any other state), while Nicky and Ginger lie, cheat, and steal their respective ways to the top. The film's first hour and a half details their rise to power, while the second half follows their downfall as the FBI, corrupt government officials, and angry mob bosses pick apart their Camelot piece by piece.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a futuristic world devastated by disease, a convict (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time to gather information about the man-made virus that wiped out most of the human population on the planet.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
An intense film about time travel, this sci-fi entry was directed by Terry Gilliam, a member of the comedy troupe Monty Python. The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, but as he delves into the mystery, he hears voices, loses his bearings, and doubts his own sanity. He must figure out if Goines, who seems to be a raving lunatic, holds the key to the puzzle.

Bumbling, interminably shy and far too nervous to tell her how he feels, Mario becomes inspired when a world-famous Chilean poet visits the small island community.

But like many of us, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) never could have predicted the course his own life would take, when he reluctantly accepts a job as a teacher. 

A musician and composer consumed with a love for music, Holland's true goal is to write one memorable piece of music to leave his mark on the world. But instead, he finds his calling in the most unlikely place, sharing his love of music with his students--to let it fill their lives, the way it fills his. His students respond to his contagious passion, and as the years unfold, Holland finds himself on an unplanned path. 

Redefining success and his own dreams, Holland realizes that his legacy will be greater than he ever dreamed. And with the help of his students and his family, Glenn Holland learns that though our lives don't always turn out the way we plan them, life is what happens when you embrace the unexpected.

Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood (1996) Official Trailer #1

""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking your Juice in the Hood"" is a parody of a lot of black U.S. movies, for instance ""Boyz n the Hood"", ""South Central"", ""Menace II Society"", ""Higher Learning"" and ""Juice"". We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.

Wayne Wang's follow-up movie to Smoke presents a series of improvisational situations strung together to form a pastiche of Brooklyn's diverse ethnicity, offbeat humor, and essential humanity. Many of the same characters inhabiting Auggie Wren's Brooklyn Cigar Store in Smoke return here to expound on their philosophy of smoking, relationships, baseball, New York, and Belgian Waffles. Most of all, this is a movie about living life, off-the-cuff.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Taplow (Ben Silverstone) attempts to ask a favor of Mr. Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney), a spiteful headmaster on the verge of retirement.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Forty-three years after the first screen treatment of Terence Rattigan's play about a teacher facing the end of his career, Albert Finney takes on the role of Mr. Crocker-Harris, the Latin teacher forced into early retirement by a heart condition. After teaching in a public school for twenty years, Crocker-Harris is being put out to pasture in a less stressful job teaching English to foreigners. Meanwhile, his home life is also falling apart: his wife (Greta Scacchi) is having an affair with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who nevertheless admires Crocker-Harris for his dignity and decency. Through it all, Crocker-Harris hides his pain behind his stiff British reserve.

"" Time never dies. The circle is never round. ""

The first film made in the newly independent Republic of Macedonia, Milcho Manchevski's Before the Rain crosscuts the stories of an orthodox Christian monk (Grégoire Colin), a British photo agent (Katrin Cartlidge), and a native Macedonian war photographer (Rade Šerbedžija) to paint a portrait of simmering ethnic and religious hatred about to reach its boiling point. Made during the strife of the war-torn Balkan states in the nineties, this gripping triptych of love and violence is also a timeless evocation of the loss of pastoral innocence, and remains one of recent cinema's most powerful laments on the futility of war.

The movie won more than 30 awards including Golden Lion in Venice and earned an Oscar nomination!

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A day in the lives of two convenience clerks as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
When Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) is reluctantly put in charge of the Quick Stop market on his day off, he tries, though half-heartedly, to perform his minimum-wage duties as efficiently as possible. This gets tough amidst the on-going fight with his girlfriend, Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti), and his attempt to get back together with his ex-girlfriend, Caitlyn Bree (Lisa Spoonhauer). Meanwhile, his friend and alter ego Randall (Jeff Anderson) is working behind the counter of the adjacent video store -- at least when he feels like it. Randall's unabashed disdain of his place of employment, a long with his self-admitted hatred towards its customers is a sharp contrast to Dante's feeble attempts at the niceties of customer service. Much of the film consists of Randall and Dante's criticism of their customers, their lives, and the world in general. Clerks, filmed in black-and-white on a budget of only $27,000, began the career of writer director Kevin Smith, who would go on to make Mallrats (1995), Chasing Amy (1997), Dogma (1999), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001).

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Hit men, gangsters and robbers converge in Quentin Tarantino's violent tale of revenge. Stars John Travolta Samuel L. Jackson Bruce Willis and Uma Thurman

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.

Inspired by the paranoid visions of John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds, the desert noir of Detour and the black and white widescreen beauty of Hiroshi Teshigahara’s The Face of Another and Woman of the Dunes, Suture is one of great feature debuts – by writer-directors David Siegel and Scott McGehee – and a truly unique piece of cinema.

The wealthy and self-assured Vincent (Michael Harris) meets his blue collar half-brother Clay (Dennis Haysbert) at their father’s funeral and is struck by their similarity. He decides to murder Clay and take his identity, only Clay survives the assassination attempt with no memory and is mistaken for Vincent. The fact that Harris is white and Haysbert is black only complicates a film that probes into the nature of identity.

After viewing an early rough cut, Steven Soderbergh came on board as executive producer and enthusiastic patron. Suture went on to become a hit on the festival circuit, including Sundance where it deservedly won the award for Best Cinematography.

FILM SYNOPSIS
A spellbinding account of the career of the most renowned woman director, best known as Hitler's moviemaker and recently hailed by The New York Times as ""one of the greatest woman filmmakers ever."" In this remarkable documentary, Leni Riefenstahl addresses her past for the first time on camera.

While she never actually joined the Nazi Party, as the creator of the single most effective propaganda film ever made, Triumph of the Will, Riefenstahl has spent much of her life trying to live down her association with the Third Reich. Her personal relationship with Hitler is still in question.

Feisty and charismatic at 91, Riefenstahl revisits the landmarks of her turbulent life -- from her beginnings as a daredevil actress in German ""mountain films"" to her direction of such stunning narratives as The Blue Light (1932) and Tiefland (1940s, released in 1954), to her infamous, brilliant documentaries Triumph of the Will (1935) and Olympia (1938), to her anthropological photographs of the now extinct Nuba tribes in Africa. The film brings the story of Riefenstahl right up to her current passion, scuba diving and shooting films of exotic aquatic life. All together, a riveting story that leaves the viewer in total awe of its controversial subject.

I also liked this movie even though I haven&#39;t really seen the entire movie since it was released on video.
302,Philadelphia (1993),"With Hanks, who is always watchable, and Washington, who has also got a very good track record, this film was destined to be fantastic but not even I, who always has an optimistic view when it comes to movies, was ready for the impact that this film made. Tom Hanks excelled even himself with his performance as an AIDS striken homosexual who is fired from his job simply because of his condition. It is Hanks, by himself, who makes the whole scenario in the film believable. Although this is Hanks's best performance of his career, he is very closely followed by Denzel Washington who gives a perfect performance as the only lawyer who will take on the case although he is a homophobe himself. The emotional strain of the film on the audience is immense and in the later stages of the film it is almost impossible to watch because of that. The make-up which gives the impression that Hanks really does have the terrible disease is perfect and the simple yet striking direction from Jonathan Demme(The Silence Of The Lambs) make this utterly compelling viewing although at times it is very uncomfortable. All praise to everyone in the making of this beautiful film.

I'm posting this message to let others who wish to embed this know that this isn't the real trailer. In fact, a few contradictions to the actual movie plot are played on. 

For those of you who are fans of ""The Three Musketeers"" (Chris O'Donnell; Kiefer Sutherland), I've created a recut trailer making the musketeers slightly more ""bad-ass"", who fight the king. Cardinal Richelieu tries to protect the king from the rogue musketeers, making him a good guy.

Note that this is my first non-horror/thriller recut, rather a redo trailer with a lot of twists to the old story. The action (I hope) will make up for the lack of the horror feel.

Also, I guarantee that there is no other trailer like this one for this movie anywhere. You might even feel like watching the real movie after viewing this. Of course, all credit would go to Disney and Caravan for producing this fun film. Enjoy!",124831,124,0,20,176.0,Estoy buscando esta pelicula en dvd me encanta

347,Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991),"A sequel to the sci-fi action thriller that made him and star Arnold Schwarzenegger A-list Hollywood names, writer/director James Cameron upped the ante with this follow-up by employing a more sweeping storyline and cutting-edge special effects. Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor, now a single mother to rebellious teen John Connor (Edward Furlong), during the late nineties. Having been informed by a time-traveling soldier in the first film that John will one day grow up to become humanity's savior from a computer-controlled Armageddon, Sarah has responded by becoming a muscle-bound she-warrior bent on educating John in survival tactics and battle strategies. Her ranting about humankind's future has landed Sarah in an insane asylum and John in the foster care system. The rebellious John has responded to his situation by getting into scrapes with the law. When a new and improved Terminator android called the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) arrives from the future to eliminate John, an older model T-800 (Schwarzenegger) is sent to protect the boy. The T-1000, however, has the ability to morph itself into any shape it desires, allowing it chameleon-like powers and near indestructibility. The T-800 saves John's life and helps break Sarah out of the institution. Staying only one step ahead of the dogged T-1000, Sarah leads her son and the T-800 to the headquarters of Cyberdyne Systems, the company that will invent a robotic intelligence that will eventually take over the world. There, they attempt to convince inventor Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) to help them stop the future from ever occurring by destroying his work. Dyson sacrifices himself in an explosion to save the world, leading to a final showdown between the two Terminators at a steel foundry. Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), which won four Oscars in technical categories for its groundbreaking effects, was followed by a short sequel filmed exclusively as an attraction for theme parks, Terminator 2: 3-D Battle Across Time (1996). - Karl Williams, Rovi

348,Dances with Wolves (1990),"Release Date: November 21, 1990

A historical drama about the relationship between a Civil War soldier and a band of Sioux Indians, Kevin Costner's directorial debut was also a surprisingly popular hit, considering its length, period setting, and often somber tone. The film opens on a particularly dark note, as melancholy Union lieutenant John W. Dunbar attempts to kill himself on a suicide mission, but instead becomes an unintentional hero.

His actions lead to his reassignment to a remote post in remote South Dakota, where he encounters the Sioux. Attracted by the natural simplicity of their lifestyle, he chooses to leave his former life behind to join them, taking on the name Dances with Wolves. Soon, Dances with Wolves has become a welcome member of the tribe and fallen in love with a white woman who has been raised amongst the tribe.

His peaceful existence is threatened, however, when Union soldiers arrive with designs on the Sioux land.

The film has won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Tom (David Schwimmer) freaks out when his high school crush, Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), shows up, and hassles Scott (Michael Vartan) for his shirt.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This dark comedy is a clever homage to classic generation gap comedies such as The Graduate (1967), The Last Picture Show (1971) and The Big Chill (1983), filtered through an ironic Generation X lens. Tom Thompson (David Schwimmer) is unemployed and aimless, hovering between childhood and adult responsibilities. A year out of college, Tom can't land a decent job -- he still lives with his mother in Brooklyn. He receives a call from Ruth Abernathy (Barbara Hershey), who informs Tom that her son Bill, Tom's best friend in high school, has killed himself. She wants Tom to deliver the eulogy and serve as a pallbearer, and flustered, Tom agrees, though he has no recollection of Bill. After delivering a lackluster eulogy, Tom meets the grieving Ruth and begins an impulsive affair with her. He also encounters Julie DeMarco (Gwyneth Paltrow), a beautiful classmate for whom he's long carried a torch. Although Julie at first mistakes Tom for someone else, they begin dating, while he keeps his relationship with Ruth a secret. First-time writer-director Matt Reeves work-shopped the script for The Pallbearer with writing partner Jason Katims at the Sundance Institute. Reeves went on to create the TV series Felicity.

Angus is fat, dorky and smart, a kid with an uncool pal and a crush on a cheerleader. Angus is funny, rowdy and triumphant, a totally cool movie with a dead-on eye and ear for the hilarious, heartbreaking rite of passage called high school. A great cast (including Academy Award® winners* George C. Scott and Kathy Bates as Anguss oddball family) sparks this story about what happens when Angus is named King of the Winter Ball as a prank and how he turns humiliation into victory. Angus, Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, delivers a rousing up yours to all the snotty high school golden boys [and] a climax that I, for one, found wholly the equal of anything in Rocky.

Directed By Patrick Read Johnson
Starring Charlie Talbert, George C. Scott, Kathy Bates

Dead Man (1995) Official Trailer - Johnny Depp Movie HD

Dead Man is the story of a young man's journey, both physically and spiritually, into very unfamiliar terrain. William Blake travels to the extreme western frontiers of America sometime in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Lost and badly wounded, he encounters a very odd, outcast Native American, named ""Nobody,"" who believes Blake is actually the dead English poet of the same name. The story, with Nobody's help, leads William Blake through situations that are in turn comical and violent. Contrary to his nature, circumstances transform Blake into a hunted outlaw, a killer, and a man whose physical existence is slowly slipping away. Thrown into a world that is cruel and chaotic, his eyes are opened to the fragility that defines the realm of the living. It is as though he passes through the surface of a mirror, and emerges into a previously-unknown world that exists on the other side.

The farm is wroked by Sarah Anders, whose husband is away fighting for the Confederate Army. Far from the great armies and battlefields, a very private civil war erupts. The Captain and Sarah are pulled apart by the war's undertow into choices they can not fully control or understand. Each character in this drama must decide whether loyalty will be paid in blood. This story has a relevance to current partisan conflicts. Armies are not filled with murdering psychopaths. Good people can be driven to do bad things. The story chronicles the pathology of war, how escalating events can trigger unasked-for tragedy. Based on a true story about a southern child who shot and killed a union soldier during the Civil War.

460,Harriet the Spy (1996),"Harriet the Spy is a 1996 comedy-drama and mystery film adaptation of the 1964 novel of the same name by Louise Fitzhugh, and starring Michelle Trachtenberg as the title character.
This film was directed by Bronwen Hughes, produced by Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon Movies and Rastar. This was the first film that was produced under the Nickelodeon Movies banner, and the first of two film adaptations of the Harriet the Spy books. In theaters, the pilot episode of Hey Arnold! was shown before the film.
The film was shot in the Florida cities of Fort Lauderdale and Miami, plus Toronto, Ontario.
The film was released in US theaters on July 10, 1996, and the film grossed $6,601,651 on its opening weekend, averaging about $3,615 per each of the 1,826 screens it was shown on.[1] The film went on to gross a total of $26,570,048 by November 10, 1996, and was considered a box office success, earning back double its $13,000,000 budget.

Do they want compliments that much? And why didn&#39;t Harriet apologised right a way saying sorry is not that hard. This movie is full of rash bullying, violence, friends turning on each other and saying lying is a good thing. There&#39;s a reason why this book 📖 is banned from school libraries. Parents and teachers are right to challenge it. How did this book became famous anyway? Why do people like it?<br>Harriet is a terrible role model. Don&#39;t let your kids watch the movie."

Though they disagree about nearly everything, they have one think in common: Mickey's ex-fiancee Heather is Francis's secret lover. Though both brothers have beautiful wives, Heather triggers their longtime sibling rivalry with uproarious and unexpected results.

Gene Kelly is at his toe-tapping best as Jerry Mulligan, a former GI who dreams of finding success as an artist.  A chance encounter with shopgirl Lise (Leslie Caron), however, throws his life into a whirlwind of romantic roundabouts.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Regina (Audrey Hepburn) flees with Peter (Cary Grant) away from greedy pursuers after her dead husband's fortune.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn star in this stylish comedy-thriller directed by Stanley Donen, very much in a Hitchcock vein. Grant plays Peter Joshua, who meets Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) in Paris and later offers to help her when she discovers that her husband has been murdered. After the funeral, Reggie is summoned to the embassy and warned by agent/friend Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) that her late husband helped steal 250,000 dollars during the war and that the rest of the gang is after the money as well. When three of the men who attended her husband's funeral begin to harass her, Reggie goes to Joshua for help, at which time Joshua confesses that his name is actually Alexander Dyle, the brother of a fourth accomplice in the gold theft. The three men from the funeral are revealed to be the three other accomplices in the crime, and though she knows next to nothing of the heist, Reggie is caught in a ring of suspense as she is followed by the shadowy trio, all after the money. Apparently, the only person she can trust is Joshua/Dyle -- until Bartholomew tells Reggie that the fourth accomplice had no brother, and Joshua/Dyle reveals that he is, in fact, a crook named Adam Canfield. Now Reggie doesn't know where to turn. The musical score by Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini was nominated for an Academy Award.

In honor of its 50th Anniversary, this eight time OSCAR winning musical has been restored frame-by-frame from the original 65mm negative and scanned utilizing start-of-the-art technology under the supervision of Robert Harris (the famed film historian).

Audrey Hepburn has never looked more radiant than as Eliza Doolittle who finds herself at the center of a friendly wager between Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and his companion, Colonel Pickering (Wilfred Hyde-White). Can this disheveled, cockney flower girl find her voice and blossom into a proper lady presentable in high society?  Performance, style and sweet spirit…plus an unforgettable score… have made My Fair Lady one of the greatest musicals in film history and a beloved and timeless classic that begs to be experienced on the big screen.

This ectoplasmic romance between Gene Tierney (as the most beautiful spinster ever to don a shawl and wire-rim glasses) and Rex Harrison as the sea-faring ghost who loves her is a match not made in heaven but certainly headed there. Bernard Herrmann’s wistful score is the finishing touch on one of the greatest date-night movies ever.

536,To Be or Not to Be (1942),"Jack Benny's greatest movie role, and no wonder--it was written especially for him by Ernst Lubitsch! Carole Lombard's swan song earned her some of her finest reviews posthumously, but the film itself, daringly dark for the time, was generally regarded as an insensitive and even troubling satire of wartime issues. The title refers not only to Shakespeare but the questionable existence of Poland. It has since been recognized as one of the director's finest efforts and a brilliantly cast comedy classic. Remade in 1983 with Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft in the leads.

What he did to Shakespeare, we are now doing to Poland!&quot;<br><br>Still, my favorite line from the movie -- but so many critics back then saw it as offensive.  Jack Benny is absolutely perfect as the vainglorious Tura, and this is definitely his greatest movie.  He doesn&#39;t really fall back on the &quot;Jack Benny&quot; character, and his chemistry with Carole Lombard is delicious.  Shame we lost her so soon after filming ended.   Jack said years later that he knew that this was something special, and he remembered being horrified when he learned that Carole had been killed before what they felt was her finest role.  He was good friends with Carole and with Clark Gable, and his thoughts were very much on them when the film was released.  I heard that Gable never really recovered from Carole&#39;s death, and his last wife Kay Spreckels had a distinct resemblance to Carole.<br><br>Many thought at the time the film was badly timed and inappropriate now that America had entered the war, but now the film is seen as the classic it is.  Mel Brooks&#39; remake is terrible on its own, IMO, but especially in context with the original.  THIS is the version to see -- Jack Benny MAKES this film, and Mel Brooks is no Jack Benny."

Penny Serenade (1941)
Η.Π.Α. - Ασπρόμαυρη - 119'

Μια ιστορία για όσους έχουν αγαπήσει...
και για εκείνους που δεν έχουν,
αλλά ελπίζουν να αγαπήσουν.

Μια συναισθηματική ταινία με στιγμές σπαρακτικού πάθος και γέλιου.

Τα μεγάλα όνειρα ενός ζευγαριού δίνουν τη θέση τους σε μια ζωή
γεμάτη από απροσδόκητη θλίψη και απρόσμενη χαρά.

Η εξαιρετική ηθοποιία του Κάρι Γκραντ και της Αϊρίν Νταν
προσδίδουν στην ταινία μια ιδιαίτερη ποιότητα.

Η Τζούλι είναι έτοιμη να εγκαταλείψει τον σύζυγο της, Ρότζερ, όταν βάζει συγκεκριμένες ηχογραφήσεις που θυμίζουν γεγονότα από την μεταξύ τους ζωή. Ένα από αυτά είναι το τραγούδι που ακούσαν όταν πρωτογνωρίστηκαν σε μαγαζί δίσκων. 

Ένα βήμα πριν εγκαταλείψει τον σύζυγο της, η Τζούλι ακούει τις μελωδίες που έχει συλλέξει και κάθε τραγούδι της θυμίζει ένα στάδιο της ζωής τους μαζί ...

It is only finally when she dies that he can break free from the bond that ties him to her.

Johns was one of several films dealing with this subject matter that were released in 1996. Others included Skin & Bone (in which Arquette had a cameo as a client) and Hustler White.

Previously, Dick Powell was known only for comedies and musicals, so his appearance in a film noir makes Murder My Sweet an especially unique choice for your mystery collection. His name is Phillip Marlowe, and for the right price, this private eye will follow an unfaithful husband, find a missing bankroll, or spy on a suspicious neighbor. When he's drawn into a complex web of murder, blackmail and double-dealing, the result is the quintessential film-noir—the one that set the standard for the noir genre.",40570,231,0,5,129.0,moose is gangaster he search velma but she dont like him she is evil

Monty Python delivers the group's sharpest and smartest satire of both religion and Hollywood's epic films.  Set in 33 A.D. Judea where the exasperated Romans try to impose order, it is a time of chaos and change with no shortage of messiahs and follwers willing to belive in them.  At its center is Brian Cohen, born in Bethleham in a stable next door, who, by a series of absurd circumstances is caught up in the new religion and reluctantly mistaken for the promised messiah, providing ample opportunity for the entire ensemble (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin) to shine in mulitple roles as they question everyone and everything from ex-lepers, Pontius Pilate and haggling to revolutionaries, crazy prophets, religious fanaticism, Roman centurions and crucifixion, forever changing our biblical view.",777397,2071,0,122,171.0,"If someone asks it&#39;s Self how Brian could be in Reality, then I could answer, it would be Pharmaceutical Engineers, everyone believes, it will bring the Cure for Everything in Life."

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
After a simple jewelery heist goes terribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
In 1992, Reservoir Dogs transformed Quentin Tarantino practically overnight from an obscure, unproduced screenwriter and part-time actor to the most influential new filmmaker of the 1990s. The story looks at what happens before and after (but not during) a botched jewelry store robbery organized by Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) is a career criminal who takes a liking to newcomer Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and enjoys showing him the ropes. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is a weaselly loner obsessed with professionalism. Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) has just gotten out of jail after taking the rap on a job for Cabot; he's grateful for the work but isn't the same person he used to be. While Mr. Blonde goes nuts during the heist, the thieves are surprised by the sudden arrival of the police, and Mr. Pink is convinced one of their team is a cop. So who's the rat? What do they do about Mr. Blonde? And what do they do with Mr. Orange, who took a bullet in the gut and is slowly bleeding to death? Reservoir Dogs jumps back and forth between pre- and post-robbery events, occasionally putting the narrative on pause to let the characters discuss such topics as the relative importance of tipping, who starred in Get Christie Love!, and what to do when you enter a men's room full of cops carrying a briefcase full of marijuana.

Critical reaction was mixed and the box-office weak, but all of Oliver Stone’s films are passion projects and The Doors is no different: like Morrison himself, Stone’s movie is never dull or doctrinaire.

The pressure cooker plot about four real estate agents fighting for their jobs in a claustrophobic Chicago office space is punctuated by Mamet’s memorably mean-spirited dialogue which is delivered by some of the finest actors of the time including Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin and Ed Harris. Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award and Lemmon was voted Best Actor by the National Board of Review.

The Funeral is a 1996 American crime-drama film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Annabella Sciorra, Isabella Rossellini, Vincent Gallo, Benicio del Toro and Gretchen Mol.

The story concerns the funeral of one of three brothers in a family of gangsters that lived in New York in 1930s. It is a film that details the past of the brothers and their families through a series of flashbacks. The film is most notable for its shocking climax.

Chris Penn won the best supporting actor award at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for his performance.

Plot:

The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers. These men are violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating. Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks show us that Johnny was more sensitive. Exposure to Communist meetings as a spy sway Johnny's opinions.

The chief suspect in Johnny's murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.

Ray and Chez swear revenge. Ray's wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez' wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband's obsessive nature.

As it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who first claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend, but who later admits, just before Ray kills him, that he wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends.

As he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers' lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray's house and shoots Ray's bodyguards, shoots his dead brother Johnny lying in the casket, shoots Ray, and then puts the gun in his own mouth and commits suicide as the family women wail over Ray as he too dies.",82914,284,0,51,141.0,Who is the young boy in the movie who shoots the black man in the alley on a chair?

Two time Oscar® -winner Milos Forman (Amadeus, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) directs Woody Harrelson, Courtney Love and Edward Norton in this ""smart, funny, shamelessly entertaining"" film called ""a blazing triumph"" by The New York Times.
 
Based on a true story of the notorious Hustler publisher who was sued by the Religious Right and paralysed by a fanatic's bullet, The People Vs Larry Flint is a stranger-than-fiction comedy about one man's outrageous public persona and eccentric private life. The film chronicles Flynt's raunchy business savvy, his wildly unconventional marriage and his infamous courtroom antics, The People Vs Larry Flint is ""the most scintillating and outrageous message movie of the decade.

Those sailors vowed to return and that’s just what they do, using the fog that blankets this little seaside town as their method of transportation. Starring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh, the film was a solid success bringing in nearly $22 million on its $1 million budget. The Fog was remade in 2005, directed by Rupert Wainwright and starring Selma Blair.

Bob Roberts Trailer - Directed by Tim Robbins and starring Tim Robbins, Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Rickman, Ray Wise, Brian Murray. Mock documentary about an upstart candidate for the U.S. Senate written and directed by actor Tim Robbins. Bob Roberts is a folksinger with a difference: He offers tunes that protest welfare chiselers, liberal whining, and the like. As the filmmakers follow his campaign, Robbins gives needle-sharp insight into the way candidates manipulate the media.

655,Paths of Glory (1957),"Here is the all-new original Masters of Cinema trailer for PATHS OF GLORY!

A shattering masterpiece by one of the medium’s greatest artists, Stanley Kubrick’s Paths of Glory announced the definitive arrival of a towering figure in cinema.

In the French front lines of World War I, after giving the order for an impossible and disastrous mission to capture a nearby stronghold, the upper ranks move to save face by having three randomly selected soldiers held and tried for cowardice under pain of death. Their leader, Colonel Dax (in a powerhouse performance by Kirk Douglas) a former lawyer in civilian life, handles their defence against overwhelming odds.

A stylistically astonishing, emotionally overwhelming anti-war drama, Paths of Glory is one of the screen’s most brilliant condemnations of the power structures guiding warfare. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present a new Blu-ray edition for the first time in the UK from 19 Sept 2016.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Colonel Shaw (Matthew Broderick) leads his company at the battle of Antietam.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the Civil War. Simply put, the heroes involved have been ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, headed by Col. Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers are denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; as in armies past and future, they are given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. Still, none of the soldiers quit the regiment when given the chance. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit themselves valiantly at Fort Wagner, SC, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. Glory was based on Lincoln Kirstein's Lay This Laurel and Peter Burchard's One Gallant Rush; the latter book was founded on the letters of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, the real-life character played by Matthew Broderick. The film won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for co-star Denzel Washington, and additional statuettes for Best Cinematography (Freddie Francis) and Sound Recording.

705,Touch of Evil (1958),"Here’s our brand new trailer for Orson Welles’ noir masterpiece Touch of Evil, which returns to cinemas across the UK from 10 July.

For more information on the nationwide release click here

http://www.bfi.org.uk/whats-on/bfi-film-releases/touch-evil

“A brilliant fusion of pulp art with continental sophistication; it has all the energetic cruddiness of a Sammy Fuller ‘B’ picture, and all the self-consciousness of a New Wave melodrama.”
James Naremore, The Magic World of Orson Welles, 1978

Charlton Heston (starring here as Mexican border cop Mike Vargas) was apparently instrumental in persuading B-movie producer Albert Zugsmith to hire Orson Welles – who hadn’t directed in Hollywood for a decade – to make Touch of Evil.

Beginning with one of the most celebrated tracking shots in cinema history, a bravura three-minute take in which a bomb is planted in a car that then explodes after crossing the US border, Welles created a baroque, highly stylised masterpiece from inauspiciously pulpy source material.

With its story of murder, marijuana and police corruption, Touch of Evil is considered among the last of the 1940s/50s cycle of crime thrillers known as film noir. Welles’ vivid turn as corpulent bent cop Quinlan provided one of the genre’s most memorable villains.

Iniquity south of the border also colours Welles’ prior film noir, The Lady from Shanghai (1947), starring his then-wife Rita Hayworth.

Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece of modern horror is widely considered to be the most terrifying movie of all time.

Based on Stephen King's bestselling novel, this tale of a family man and would-be writer (Jack Nicholson) going mad as winter caretaker of the cursed Overlook Hotel is a seminal work of the genre. It is also, as Martin Scorsese has pointed out, like no other horror film ever made -- 'essentially unclassifiable, endlessly provocative and profoundly disturbing'. The BFI will release a magnificent new digital transfer from Warner Bros. of the US version which has never before been released in the UK and which -- at 144 minutes -- runs 24 minutes longer than the European version previously seen.

ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ , имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. &quot;ПРИВОДИТЬ&quot; НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. <br><br>МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО.  ГЛАВНЫЙ ГЕРОЙ ПРЕВРАТИЛСЯ В ПСИХОПАТА убийцу и пытался убить свою семью, ЭТО ОБРАЗ, и означает следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА надо ПОНИМАТЬ, а почему, например всё тоже самое присходит с людьми и в реальной жизни.  Всё ДЕЛО В ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЯХ, КОТОРЫМИ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА. И ПРОЖИВАЯ свою земную ЖИЗНЬ ВО ГРЕХЕ, А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ . РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ, БЕСОВ других ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола, МЫ сначала И ВПУСКАЕМ В СВОЮ ДУШУ очень сильных ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ той или иной ПОРОЧНОЙ СТРАСТИ, а потом и дьявол полностью овладевает душой человека, делая его безрассудным, полностью подчиняет его волю своей. Так и В самом ФИЛЬМЕ, ФОТОГРАФИЮ ГЛАВНОГО ГЕРОЯ НА ФОНЕ невидимых ЛЮДЕЙ, с которыми он присутствовал сначала в баре, надо воспринимать именно так.  ЭТО уже не люди, а все ЕГО многочисленные ДЕМОНЫ МУЧИТЕЛИ, которых он впустил в свою душу, проживая свою жизнь во грехе, КОТОРЫЕ и ЛИШИЛИ в результате ЕГО РАССУДКА. ЧТО КАСАЕТСЯ маленького МАЛЬЧИКА, разговаривающего с «кем-то»  кто «прибывал» в его голове. ЭТО образ, который тоже надо понимать следующим образом. Дело в том что какая либо порочная страсть может быть так сильна в человеке, что он уже даже в мыслях, в таком юном возрасте, уподобляется большому греху, в результате которого какой либо ДЕМОН завладевает его душой, и начинает С НИМ РАЗГОВАРИВАТЬ. И вот как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «тонкие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.<br><br>А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ . И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНИ , но БОЛЕЗНИ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле.  А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ от этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. СНАЧАЛА в мир БЫЛ &quot;ПОСЛАН&quot; для этого СЫН БОЖИЙ ИИСУС ХРИСТОС(имя ИИСУС кстати означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). Но ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.<br><br>И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.<br><br>Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет &quot;БОРОТЬСЯ&quot; СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ , ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕ ВИДИМОГО), СЫНА(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. <br><br>А ЧТОБЫ  &quot;ПРИЙТИ&quot; к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  <br><br>Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что написано выше , И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, ВОЗМОЖНО даже примерно 9 МЕСЯЦЕВ, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ при ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ &quot;шагом&quot; БУДЕТ (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻"

Watch your back as the trendsetters of Westerberg High School are chewing up the scenery and may just have you in their evil sights in this razor-sharp black comedy about peer group peril. Up to her neck in vitriol and sick of it, popular teenager Veronica Sawyer (Winona Ryder, Edward Scissorhands) finds herself in a tiresome tide of ins and outs, part of a cruel social clique so wrapped up in their own making that no one else stands a chance. She decides to challenge the malevolent rule of the self-appointed divas of the school scene, the Heathers (Shannen Doherty, Lisanne Falk and Kim Walker), and begins a torrid journey of blackmail, sex, revenge and murder. With the aid of rebellious newcomer Jason Dean (Christian Slater, True Romance) Veronica is set to revolutionise the classroom and turn popular perception upside down. Heathers, the original '80s cult classic, returns us to a time of 'swatch dogs', 'diet coke heads' and a bunch of croquet playing queen bees that will have you laughing to the last despicable gasp. Lick it up baby, and get in line, because 'bulimia is so '87!'",119709,978,0,42,108.0,Ngl i love the three blind mice music in this Trailer gives me a goofy haunting 80s feeling

Millions of years later what remained of the Krell were discovered by archaeologists and the crew of the Bellerophon. But they unwittingly opened Pandora&#39;s box and were annihilated by things they could not understand. Their doom was the result of the Captain and the Bellerophon&#39;s crew having completed their primary mission wanted to leave Altair IV and head back to Earth, but Morbius and wife were unwilling and refused due to their love of Altair IV. The struggle between Morbius and the rest of the crew set off a chain reaction in Morbius&#39;s reptailian brain, the id. Unknowingly to Morbius, that anger and hatred was amplified, multiplied millions of times and projected into reality by Krell devices, still running for millions of years. All of the Bellerophon&#39;s crew were hunted down and killed by invisible monsters who literally tore them into pieces, killing them, and the few that made it to the Bellerophon were vaporized by a ray blast also created from Morbius id by the Krell machines. After the destruction, the monsters mysteriously disappear as Morbius&#39;s id is satisfied and the Krell device shuts down. Afterwards, Morbius and wife attempt to build a life on Altair IV. They started to build a family having a child they named Altaira, but Morbius wife dies a few months later after the birth of their daughter. Morbius raises the child, builds a house and being a Philolgist begins to study and learn about the Krell civilization and their technology, he eventually builds a robot named Robby that employs AI. As the years go by, Morbius&#39;s knowledge of Krell technology grows enormously and he has no time for trivial projects .<br><br>Part 3. 20 years later the C57D arrives, but this time we (audience) find out that the Krell are not dead, they live in a realm without instrumentality, without bodies.

The machine is maintaining the realm where the Krel live. Part 3 is similar to the story line in the original FP, but in this case it is humanity that destroys the Krell when Morbius throws the switch and tells J.J. Adams he has 24 hours to get Altaira, himself and crew a million miles away from Altair IV as a planetary destruction sequence has started and cannot be halted.<br><br>Morbius&#39;s passion was to study to learn about the Krell, he knew that their knowledge was far too dangerous for humanity to handle, yet is is he who destroys the Krell to prevent  / forbid humanity from possessing Krell knowledge."

Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins star in director Francis Ford Coppola's visually stunning, passionately seductive version of the classic Dracula legend. In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Coppola returns to the original source of the Dracula myth, and from that gothic romance, he creates a modern masterpiece. Gary Oldman's metamorphosis as Dracula who grows from old to young, from man to beast is nothing short of amazing. Winona Ryder brings equal intensity to the role of a young beauty who becomes the object of Dracula's devastating desire. Anthony Hopkins co-stars as the famed doctor who dares to believe in Dracula, and then dares to confront him. Opulent, dazzling and utterly irresistible, this is Dracula as you've never seen him. And once you've seen Bram Stoker's Dracula, you'll never forget it.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Dr. Frankenstein (Colin Clive), goaded by an even madder scientist (Ernest Thesinger), builds his monster(Boris Karloff) a mate (Elsa Lanchester).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This greatest of all Frankenstein movies begins during a raging thunderstorm. Warm and cozy inside their palatial villa, Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon), Percy Shelley (Douglas Walton), and Shelley's wife Mary (Elsa Lanchester) engage in morbidly sparkling conversation. The wicked Byron mockingly chastises Mary for frightening the literary world with her recent novel Frankenstein, but Mary insists that her horror tale preached a valuable moral, that man was not meant to dabble in the works of God. Moreover, Mary adds that her story did not end with the death of Frankenstein's monster, whereupon she tells the enthralled Byron and Shelley what happened next. Surviving the windmill fire that brought the original 1931 Frankenstein to a close, the Monster (Boris Karloff) quickly revives and goes on another rampage of death and destruction. Meanwhile, his ailing creator Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) discovers that his former mentor, the demented Doctor Praetorius (Ernst Thesiger), plans to create another life-sized monster -- this time a woman! After a wild and wooly ""creation"" sequence, the bandages are unwrapped, and the Bride of the Monster (Elsa Lanchester again) emerges. Alas, the Monster's tender efforts to connect with his new Mate are rewarded only by her revulsion and hoarse screams. ""She hate me,"" he growls, ""Just like others!"" Wonderfully acted and directed, The Bride of Frankenstein is further enhanced by the vivid Franz Waxman musical score; even the film's occasional lapses in logic and continuity (it was trimmed from 90 to 75 minutes after the first preview) are oddly endearing. Director James Whale was memorably embodied by Ian McKellen in the Oscar-winning 1998 biopic Gods and Monsters.

A naive woman living in a remote Calvinist community on the Scottish coast, Bess (Emily Watson in an Academy Award® nominated performance) flaunts the will of the town's austere churchmen to marry Jan (Stellan Skarsgård, Good Will Hunter) a lusty Swede working in a nearby offshore oil rig. Her purity is put to the ultimate test when Jan is crippled in an accident and she agrees to continue their love-making vicariously through other men. Pilloried as a harlot, Bess is committed to the asylum but not before she seeks Jan's recovery through one final act of faith. Captured through Robby Mueller's (Paris, Texas) raw, relentless hand-held camera, this triumphant tale of tragedy, faith and redemption - the first in Lars Von Trier's ""Golden Heart"" trilogy on saintly heroines book-ended by Dancer in the Dark - is a cinematic tour de force.",128228,428,0,24,130.0,Does anyone know the music in this trailer?

Falling in love can be more than a state of mind and being. For defiant young lovers Harry and Kate it is an opportunity at salvation and the promise of a new beginning.

I think this is one of the greatest movies ever made, i got the orginal DVD, and i promise you.. It´s worth buying. I´ll give it 6 stars.. It´s brilliant acting, great plot.. I´ve seen it 20 times +, and I´ll never stop watching it.

Donnie Brasco is an Academy Awardnominated 1997 film by Mike Newell, starring Al Pacino, Michael Madsen and Johnny Depp. It is loosely based on the real-life events of Joseph D. Pistone, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who successfully infiltrated the Bonanno crime family, one of the Mafia's Five Families based in New York City during the 1970s, under the alias ""Donnie Brasco"". Depp met with Pistone several times while preparing for his role.

In the late 1970s, FBI agent Joe Pistone (Depp) is assigned to infiltrate the New York Citybased Bonanno crime family. Calling himself, ""Donnie Brasco"" and posing as a diamond expert from Vero Beach, Florida, he befriends Lefty Ruggiero (Pacino), a low-level mob hit man whose personal life is in tatters, and Dominick ""Sonny Black"" Napolitano (Madsen). Lefty can't seem to make any money, his son is a drug-addict and he is continually passed over for promotion to a higher position within the crime family. He continually reminds Brasco of his growing disillusionment about having spent 30 years in the Mafia (and killing 26 people), with little to show for it. In Donnie, however, Lefty sees a young protégé who might be able to succeed where he had failed. He takes Donnie under his wing, and under Lefty's tutelage Donnie quickly becomes accepted by the other Family members, although he is never elevated above the rank of ""associate"" member (the lowest mafia rank). But the longer Pistone plays the role of a gangster, the more he finds himself actually becoming Donnie Brasco during his rare off duty hours. His change in personality drives a wedge between him and his wife (played by Anne Heche) and three children. Over time, Pistone comes to realize that the slightest mistake in his performance as a mobster could result in the death of him and his family. In addition, Joe Pistone has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend. He knows that when the day finally comes that the FBI arrests his mob associates, he will be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he himself had killed him.

The film was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Adapted Screenplay

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A comic book artist (Ben Affleck) falls in love with a woman (Joey Lauren Adams) before finding out that she is a lesbian.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After a pair of films about hipster slackers, the work of writer-director Kevin Smith matured and gained critical respect with this low budget, independent comedy-drama about love, sex and the fine line between the two. Ben Affleck stars as Holden McNeil, a New Jersey comic book writer who is roommates with his best friend and professional partner, artist Banky Edwards (Jason Lee). Their hit comic book series, ""Bluntman and Chronic,"" is loosely patterned after a pair of acquaintances, Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Smith), two characters already familiar as supporting players in several Smith films. Into Holden's life comes Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams), a lesbian and fellow comic book creator who quickly becomes a close friend, although Holden is powerfully attracted to her. Eventually, Alyssa realizes that she is attracted to Holden as well and they begin a physical relationship, much to the consternation of Banky, whose ire over losing his best friend to a lesbian seems to border on romantic jealousy. After he learns something about Alyssa's sexual past, however, Holden's immature response to his new knowledge destroys both his romance with Alyssa and his friendship with Banky. Chasing Amy (1997) was the third film in what Smith referred to as his ""New Jersey series,"" films set at least partly in the Garden State and featuring the Jay and Silent Bob characters.

926,I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997),"WARNING! SPOILERS IN DESCRIPTION!

Directed By: Jim Gillespie
Starring: Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, Muse Watson

Plot:
The night of their high school graduation, Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Barry (Ryan Philippe) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr) go out of town to celebrate. Returning in Barry's new car, they hit and apparently kill a man. They dump the corpse in the ocean and agree to never discuss again what had happened.
One year later Julie is returning home from college. She has not spoken with Helen, Barry or Ray since the accident. Julie receives a letter that reads ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!"" Julie goes to see Helen's sister Elsa (Bridgette Wilson), who tells Julie that Helen has been working there. Julie shows Helen the letter and they decide to visit Barry. After going over the incident, Barry accuses Max. The three of them go to see Max, but Barry insists on going in the factory alone. Barry persuades Max to go into the back room and attacks him, telling Max he should keep his mouth shut. Julie finds Ray working on the docks. Ray tries to make up with Julie but she runs off. Inside the factory Max is murdered by someone wielding a hook. The killer attacks Barry next, running him over with Barry's car. The killer is shown wearing a raincoat and wielding a hook on one hand.
Julie arrives at the hospital to see Barry and finds Helen and Ray there. Julie reveals the man they hit was named David Eagen. Helen and Julie track his sister, Missy (Anne Heche), to her home, where she has been living since her brother's death. Missy does not recognise them and Julie is convinced she is innocent. Missy tells them she had a visit from a man claiming to be David's friend named Billy Blue.
At Helen's home that night, the killer breaks in, hiding in her closet. The next morning Helen wakes up with most of her hair cut to bits and ""SOON"" written in lipstick on her mirror. Julie gets a call from Barry, who tells her to come to Helen's. On the way, Julie hears rattling in her trunk. She opens the trunk to find Max's body. She shuts the trunk, runs to Helen's and brings her and Barry to her car, but the body has disappeared. Julie is convinced the killer took the body and they are not safe. Later they run into Ray, who tells them he got a letter. Julie decides to see Missy again while Helen and Barry watch each other's backs at the parade. Julie tries to convince Missy that David did not kill himself after Missy presents her with a suicide note written in the same style as her letter from the killer. Missy tells Julie to leave.
At the Croaker pageant, Helen sees Barry murdered by the killer. However, neither the killer nor the body are found afterwards. A police officer drives her home, but the killer lures the cop into an alley and kills him. Helen runs to her store where Elsa is working, but the killer finds and murders both of them.
Julie learns that the killer is Ben Willis, a fisherman. He murdered David Egan after David and Ben's daughter Susie were involved in a car crash near where the four teenagers hit Ben. Susie was killed in the accident and David was unharmed. Ben blamed David and killed him a year later, making it look like a suicide. On the way home, Ben was hit by the group.
Julie goes to see Ray on his boat and tells him the story, but he does not believe her. Julie notices the name on his boat is ""Billy Blue"" and accuses him of the murders. He chases her but is knocked unconscious by a man who tells Julie to get on his boat. After she does, she learns he is Ben Willis. She is chased all over the boat while Ray regains consciousness and steals a boat to save Julie. In a room full of ice, Julie finds Helen and Barry's bodies. Ray climbs aboard and is almost killed by Ben, but is caught in the boat's net. He climbs back aboard and saves Julie. Ben gets his hand caught in a rope and Ray hoists him into the air where his hand is cut off and he falls into the ocean. On land, Ray tells Julie the reason he went to see Missy was because he was guilty and had to know who they hit. He tells her he loves her and they embrace. Ben's body is not recovered.
A year later, Julie is in her second year and is going on a trip to New York with Ray. She receives a letter resembling the one she had got from Ben, but it only contains a pool party invitation. Julie returns to the bathroom, which has filled with steam. On the shower door, ""I STILL KNOW"" is written. Ben jumps through the shower door, attacking her.",1467941,3343,0,663,139.0,❤😊🎉

Director: Peter Weir
Starring: Jim Carrey, Ed Harris and Laura Linney.

Nominated for 3 Oscars, including Best Director and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ed Harris)

The Truman Show is a 1998 American satirical comedy-drama film directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol. The cast includes Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, as well as Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Ed Harris and Natascha McElhone. The film chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed reality television show, broadcast 24-hours-a-day to billions of people across the globe. Truman becomes suspicious of his perceived reality and embarks on a quest to discover the truth about his life.

The genesis of The Truman Show was a spec script by Niccol. The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction thriller, with the story set in New York City. Scott Rudin purchased the script, and instantly set the project up at Paramount Pictures. Brian De Palma was in contention to direct before Weir took over, managing to make the film for $60 million against the estimated $80 million budget. Niccol rewrote the script simultaneously as the filmmakers were waiting for Carrey's schedule to open up for filming. The majority of filming took place at Seaside, Florida, a master-planned community located in the Florida Panhandle.

The film was a financial and critical success, and earned numerous nominations at the 71st Academy Awards, 56th Golden Globe Awards, 52nd British Academy Film Awards and The Saturn Awards. The Truman Show has been analyzed as a thesis on Christianity, simulated reality, existentialism and the rise of reality television.

Plot:
An insurance salesman/adjuster discovers his entire life is actually a TV show.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A female flight attendant (Pam Grier) becomes a key figure in a plot between the police and an arms dealer.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed this adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1995 Rum Punch, switching the action from Miami to LA, and altering the central character from white to black. Ruthless arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), who lives with perpetually stoned beach-babe Melanie (Bridget Fonda), teams with his old buddy Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), just released from prison after serving four years for armed robbery. ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) bust stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), who was smuggling money into the country for Ordell. Ordell springs Jackie, but when middle-aged bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) picks her up at the jail, he's attracted to her, and they choose a romantic route with detours. Mistrust and suspicions surface after Jackie pits Ordell and the cops against each other, convincing Ordell that she's going to double-cross the cops. Tarantino commented on the film's budget: ""Jackie Brown only cost $12 million. You can't lose. You absolutely, positively can't lose. And you don't have to compromise.""

Director: Randall Wallace
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, Gérard Depardieu and John Malkovich.

The Man in the Iron Mask is a 1998 British/American historical action film directed, produced, and written by Randall Wallace. It uses characters from Alexandre Dumas' D'Artagnan Romances, and is very loosely adapted from some plot elements of The Vicomte de Bragelonne. It also bears several similarities with the 1939 film version. The movie centers on the aging Musketeers Athos, Porthos, Aramis and D'Artagnan and the reign of King Louis XIV of France. It attempts to explain the mystery of the Man in the Iron Mask, using a plot most similar to the 1939 film.

Plot: 
The cruel King Louis XIV of France has a secret twin brother who he keeps imprisoned. Can the twin be substituted for the real king?

The four-inch-tall Clock family secretly share a house with the normal-sized Lender family, ""borrowing"" such items as thread, safety pins, batteries and scraps of food.

1037,Love Walked In (1998),"Mit ""The Big Band Convention"" hat sich in der deutschen Mainstream-Jazz-Szene ein Ensemble etabliert, das selbst internationale Jazzgrößen zum schwärmen bringt. Entstanden aus dem ""Duke Ellington""-Projekt des Jazzorchesters der Kölner Musikhochschule hatte die Band nach ihrer Gründung im Frühjahr 1996 einen ungewöhnliche erfolgreichen Start. Im April 1996 nahm die Band auf Einladung von Manfred Schoof an dessen Geburtstagskonzert in der Philharmonie Köln teil, und spielte mit Rob Pronk, Ali Haurand, Gerd Dudek, Gunther Hampel und Markus Stockhausen (TV-Aufzeichnung WDR: ""Manfred Schoof - Weggefährten"").
Das Orchester hat unter der Leitung von Stefan Pfeifer bei Projekten mit Gastsolisten wie u.a. Conte Candoli, Ack van Rooyen, Al Porcino, Dick Oates, Ferdinand Povel, Heinz von Hermann, Silvia Droste, Andy Haderer, Jörg-Achim Keller, Jiggs Whigham und Ed Partyka sein hohes Niveau und seine musikalische Flexibilität unter Beweis gestellt. Die Mitglieder des Orchesters sind ausnahmslos hervorragende professionelle Musiker, die sowohl als Solisten wie als Sidemen in den unterschiedlichsten Bereichen der Musik erfolgreich tätig sind.
Das umfangreiche Bandbook umfasst unter anderem Arrangements von Bill Holman, Bob Florence, John Clayton, Don Menza, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Stan Kenton, Maynard Ferguson, Francy Boland, Jerry van Rooyen und Rob Pronk ebenso wie Musik aus den Reihen der Band. Dieses Repertoire, interpretiert mit der Leidenschaft, der Perfektion und dem mitreißenden Swing einer glänzend eingespielten Band mit ihren herausragenden Solisten, macht den Sound der ""Big Band Convention"" aus.
Das Orchester begann seine Konzerte 1996 zunächst im Stadtgarten in Köln und setzte diese mit großem Erfolg zwischen 1998 und 2003 im Rheinländer in Köln fort. Dort entstand auch die CD ""Live At The Rheinländer Cologne 2001"". Nach weiteren Stationen im Kunstsalon, Altenberger Hof, Subway und im Bogen 2 in der Hohenzollernbrücke in Köln spielt ""The Big Band Convention"" im Klub Berlin, Keplerstr. 4, 50823 Köln

Reż. Lisa Cholodenko

Syd, asystentka redaktora w magazynie Frame odkrywa, że jej sąsiadką jest utalentowaną fotografka Lucy Berliner. Zafascynowana pracami Lucy i kręgiem jej artystycznych przyjaciół, Syd szybko wnika w nowe środowisko, oddalając się od swojego chłopaka. 
Otoczenie Lucy to ludzie ogarnięci niemocą twórczą, pogrążeni w narkotykach, usprawiedliwiający własną apatię pasywnością reszty grupy. 
Syd namawia Lucy do powrotu do fotografowania na łamach Frame upatruje  w tym szansę wyrwania jej z twórczej apatii.
Między kobietami rodzi się silna więź, która skłania obie do zweryfikowania ich dotychczasowego życia zawodowego i związków.

1075,Armageddon (1998),"Release Date: July 1, 1998

Michael Bay (The Rock) directed this science fiction action thriller in the When Worlds Collide tradition. After astronomy students discover a comet-asteroid collision, an asteroid fragment ""the size of the Super Dome"" threatens. It's destroyed by a secret USA defense in space, but a large chunk veers off toward Singapore. With another asteroid ""the size of Texas"" en route, a plan is devised to send oil drillers to land on the asteroid and drop a nuclear device down a 1000-foot shaft, a scheme calculated to crack the asteroid into two halves, saving Earth. NASA begins a crash program to train beer-besotted oil roughnecks for the mission. During a stopover to refuel at the Mir Station, the space station is accidentally destroyed, so a Russian cosmonaut also joins the team. Produced by Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer (Con Air), and Gale Anne Hurd (The Relic, The Abyss).

1107,Chariots of Fire (1981),"Chariots of Fire will be release into cinemas July 13th.

Chariots of Fire tells the story of two very different men who compete as runners in the 1924 Paris Olympics: 

Eric Liddell is a devout Christian who believes that his athletic abilities are a gift from God, and that using that gift to its fullest extent - to win the gold medal - will be his way of repaying that gift. 

Harold Abrahams is an English Jew, a student at Cambridge, who dreams of fame and of proving to his anti-Semitic fellow students, and to the world, that Jews are in no respect inferior. 
Their motives are noble. Their commitment is total. Their integrity is unquestionable. They will both make personal sacrifices to achieve their goals. In the process, through all the obstacles and personal issues they conquer, they prove that striving for victory in their own terms is, perhaps, its own reward. 

Based on a true story, CHARIOTS OF FIRE was the winner of four Academy Awards®, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, in addition to receiving nominations for three more.

Rain Man Official Trailer #1 - Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman Movie (1988) HD

Selfish yuppie Charlie Babbitt's father left a fortune to his savant brother Raymond and a pittance to Charlie; they travel cross-country.

Directed by Barry Levinson and starring Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Gerald R. Molen, Jack Murdock, Michael D. Roberts. A sensible drama about the reunification of two very different brothers and their struggle to stay together. Dustin Hoffman won an Oscar for best actor for his memorable performance as the autistic Raymond.

MGM - 1988",3664475,18397,0,685,134.0,"Single worst onscreen depiction of autism ever filmed, bar none. Hoffman&#39;s performance is utterly incompetent, and it makes me sad that so many people who don&#39;t know any better actually think autistic people are like this (as a result of how this movie depicts them)."
1109,Driving Miss Daisy (1989),"Winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress (Jessica Tandy), and receiving more nominations than any other movie that year, this is the touching tale of an unusual quarter-century friendship between an eccentric elderly Southern Jewish matron and her loyal, black chauffeur. Starring Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman (""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"") and Dan Aykroyd (""Ghostbusters""), co-starring Patti LuPone (TV's ""Life Goes On"") and Esther Rolle (TV's ""Good Times"") and directed by Bruce Beresford (""Tender Mercies""). The Today Show says it ""comes close to perfection...to see it once is to remember it forever..."" Selected by the prestigious American Film Institute as one of the 400 greatest American films of all time. #Trailer #WB",359841,690,0,26,131.0,"Some of the scenes in this great movie were filmed in my hometown of Griffin, Georgia. There is one scene with Dan Ackroyd and Morgan Freeman walking through a textile mill. It was Dundee Mill #2, where I worked for several years. I worked for that company for 45 years. All the mills are closed, and most are torn down. This scene will forever be preserved on film and in our memories."

Inaccuracies
The movie incorrectly presents many aspects of Polish culture. Czarnina (duck blood soup) although very popular until the 19th century is rarely eaten now. Kielbasa (sausage), especially cooked is rarely consumed for breakfast, while each meal in the movie contains it. Music played in the film is of Balcan origin. Procession of the Virgin and selection of a virgin to lead it does not happen in the Polish Roman Catholic church. The movie plays off a number of inaccurate stereotypes. Obsession over a large number of offspring is perhaps a 19th century phenomenon, while smoking and shouting at the table are not accepted in Polish culture.",100196,104,0,33,89.0,It&#39;s not super inaccurate. The entire point surrounding the duck blood soup is that the mother and daughter are the only ones who like it. 😂 It is a Polish dish.<br><br>I think you&#39;re missing the point that this movie represents a Polish couple who immigrated to the US and had children. They&#39;re obviously not going to partake in all of the Polish traditions in America. That&#39;s where the smoking comes from.
1138,"This World, Then the Fireworks (1997)","Here is volume 2 of the 5 Minute Feature Film series, this time on Michael Oblowitz's adaptation of Jim Thompson's This World, Then the Fireworks. The 5 Minute Feature Film series is where I take a full length movie and cut it down to 5 minutes in length, re-score it, but tell basically the same story, while simultaneously analyzing the film. You can find part one here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYM7mmakRrs&context=C459aeb4ADvjVQa1PpcFMYs4RUQYrgcQmwA2q_KX0ht3SFhm2Sq-k=, where I made a 5 minute version of the Nicolas Cage/Nicole Kidman vehicle Trespass.

This World, Then the Fireworks, starring Billy Zane, Gina Gershon, Sheryl Lee, and Rue McClanahan, is a very post-modern look at film noir, like a David Lynch film, but with less consistency of vision (I uploaded the original EPK for the film on Youtube which hammers that point even more). I reviewed the film here: http://regrettablesincerity.com/?p=8458 , and by reading that piece, you'll understand my editing choices. What's most interesting is that because of Oblowitz's style, and how it would eventually completely reveal itself on the two Steven Seagal DTV movies he made (Out for a Kill and The Foreigner), the opening montage of This World, Then the Fireworks which sets up the tone of the film and the entire story, is practically incoherent. It's cut so quickly and in such a flashy manner that there's very little way to take in the important information, so, despite cutting a 100 minute film down to 5 minutes, I actually had to slow down the opening montage to make sure you could understand what was going on. The rest of the movie is less rushed, though it still has a twitchy nature to it, and my editing was aided by the broad performances and theatrical gestures by Zane, Gershon, and especially Lee.

The music you'll hear in this Five Minute Feature is from Tchaikovsky's Symphony Pathetique and Django Reinhardt's Bouncin' Around.",9630,25,0,17,282.0,A steamy offbeat gem. Grab the VCR if you can find one.
1139,Metropolis (1927),"http://www.kino.com/metropolis/
Metropolis is a 1927 silent science fiction film directed by Fritz Lang and written by Lang and Thea von Harbou. Lang and von Harbou, who were married, wrote the screenplay in 1924, and the story was novelized by von Harbou in 1926. It is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and examines a common science fiction theme of the day: the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film stars Alfred Abel as the leader of the city, Gustav Fröhlich as his son, who tries to mediate between the elite caste and the workers, Brigitte Helm as both the pure-at-heart worker Maria and the debased robot version of her, and Rudolf Klein-Rogge as the mad scientist who created the robot.

Metropolis was produced in Germany in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA) and released in 1927 during a stable period of the Weimar Republic. The most expensive film of its time, it cost approximately 7 million Reichsmark to make. The film was cut substantially after its German premiere, and there have been several efforts to restore it. Also, the American copyright lapsed in 1953, which eventually led to a proliferation of versions being released on video.

Don't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6pr

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Popeye (Robin Williams) eats a can of spinach transforming himself into ""Popeye the Sailor Man,"" and saving the day for all.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on the long-running comic strip created by E.C. Segar (and less on the animated cartoons created by Max Fleischer, which were decidedly different in tone and approach), Popeye follows the sailor man with the mighty arms (played by Robin Williams in his first major film role) as he arrives in the seaside community of Sweethaven in search of his long-lost father. Popeye meets and quickly falls for the slender Olive Oyl (Shelley Duvall, in the role she was born to play), but Olive's hand has already been promised to the hulking Bluto (Paul Smith), of whom Olive can say little except, well, he's large. Eventually, Popeye and Olive are brought together by Swee' Pea (Wesley Ivan Hurt), an adorable foundling, and Popeye finally meets his dad, Poopdeck Pappy (Ray Walston). Director Robert Altman in no way tempered his trademark style for this big-budget family opus, crowding the screen with a variety of characters and allowing his cast to overlap as much dialogue as they want.

Cast: Paul Dooley, Ray Walston, Robin Williams, Shelley Duvall, Wesley Ivan Hurt

Its lighthearted approach aside, the film is faithful enough to its grisly pulp fiction roots that certain scenes (like a bloodthirsty high priest burrowing into an unlucky native’s chest to pluck out his heart) heralded the new PG-13 rating from the MPAA.

Teague’s in-your-face action scenes were abetted by editor Neil Travis (Terminator 3) and cinematographer Jan De Bont (eleven years before his directorial debut with Speed).

A young couple have a murder to report and they go to the nearest town (Gatlin) to seek help but the town seems deserted. They are soon trapped in Gatlin with little chance of getting out alive.

Some Trivia
----------------
Though real corn was used for most of filming, polyurethane corn had to be used for the more difficult action sequences.

The tagline ""And a child shall lead them"" comes from Isaiah 11:6 in the Old Testament, which reads, ""And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.""

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Inside the vampire club, Quinn (Donal Logue) starts a fight and demands that Blade (Wesley Snipes) be hurt badly.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
British director Stephen Norrington helmed this David S. Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blade's mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires. In the 1990s (in Marvel's Nightstalkers), Blade teamed with Drake and King in an agency created to fight a variety of supernatural beings. The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blade's mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). Blade magically appears at the hospital just in time to whisk Karen to his hideaway, a machine-shop run by his mentor Abraham Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who once rescued Blade and who now produces a antidote to keep Blade from turning into a full-fledged vampire and who builds custom weapons for Blade to use against his evil foes. Meanwhile, Blade's vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire.

The BFI National Archive proudly presents the restoration of Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Lodger' (1926), featuring a new score by Nitin Sawhney commissioned by Network Releasing in partnership with the BFI and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. This restoration is part of The Genius of Hitchcock, a major celebration of Britain's most influential and iconic filmmaker. From June to October 2012 the BFI celebrates Hitchcock's life and work with a complete retrospective of his feature films; gala events, including screenings of restorations with live music, educational projects and online initiatives. For full details see http://www.bfi.org.uk/hitchcock.

London is terrorised by a Jack the Ripper-style murderer in Hitchcock's first suspense thriller, acclaimed as 'the finest British production ever made' by the Bioscope journal on its release. Hitchcock cannily cast matinee idol Ivor Novello in the title role and challenged his audience to think the worst of him.

'The Lodger' is a restoration by the BFI National Archive in association with ITV Studios Global Entertainment, Network Releasing and Park Circus Films. Principal funding provided by The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, The Film Foundation, and Simon W Hessel.

All titles on the BFI Films channel are preserved in the vast collections of the BFI National Archive. To find out more about the Archive visit http://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections",23878,138,0,8,94.0,What This Song?

In this scene, Gage's daughter Cora (Glenne Headly) gives Henderson a piece of her mind - and he learns that looks are deceiving.

Stars and Bars was NOT warmly received upon its release, and it's a shame, since it appears to have scared Daniel off from trying his hand at comedy again.

Life has just handed Beth Macauley the short straw. Her husband and suburban home are gone. She still has her two boys -- and a new destination. She's moving to the big city of Baltimore -- and into the biggest adventure of her life. Two-time Academy Award winner* Jessica Lange plays Beth in this warm-hearted, funny fable from Risky Business director Paul Brickman about staying together when all else is falling apart. Screen-debuting Chris O'Donnell (two years before his star making Scent of a Woman role) and Charlie Korsmo are the sons who unwittingly push Beth into one pitfall of single parenthood after another. Newcomers to Beth's world include an avant-garde composer (Arliss Howard), a flakier-than-cereal neighbor (Joan Cusack) and a boss (Kathy Bates) skilled in management by terror.

Directed By Paul Brickman
Starring Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Arliss Howard

For 40 years Lilian Singer has been locked up in a mental hospital by her father. Left to her own devices she has lived in a world of torment and despair completely shut off from the outside world. When Lilian's release is eventually secured by her eccentric Aunt Kitty and her brother John, she faces the great unknown and embraces it with passion and courage. Searching the streets of Sydney for the essence of love and affection she never received herself, Lilian's journey becomes one of self-realisation and underlying contentment. Explored through a series of moving flashbacks her story unfolds with a colourful rainbow of characters that rest between the dark clouds of her past.

1291,Edward Scissorhands (1990),"Edward Scissorhands is a 1990 American Romance, Horror, Gothic and fairy tale hybrid film directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. The film shows the story of an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim. Supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin.
Burton conceived the idea for Edward Scissorhands from his childhood upbringing in suburban Burbank, California. During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Caroline Thompson was hired to adapt Burton's story into a screenplay, and the film began development at 20th Century Fox, after Warner Bros. passed on the project. Edward Scissorhands was then fast tracked after Burton's success with Batman. Before Depp's casting, the leading role of Edward had been connected to Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Robert Downey, Jr., and William Hurt, while the role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and was ultimately his final performance on film.
The majority of filming took place in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida, which generated over $6 million for the local economy. Edward's scissor hands were created and designed by Stan Winston. The film is also the fourth feature collaboration between Burton and film score composer Danny Elfman. Edward Scissorhands was released with positive feedback from critics, and was a financial success. The film received numerous nominations at the Academy Awards, British Academy Film Awards, Saturn Awards, as well as winning the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. Both Burton and Elfman consider Edward Scissorhands their most personal and favorite work.

1297,"Battle of the Sexes, The (1959)","This is a clip from the magnificent 1959 GB comedy 'Battle of the sexes' by Charles Crichton, starring Peter Sellers in one of his best performances ever. 

Until a few years ago my young niece wouldn't believe that when I had her age (the seventies) it was allowed to smoke in the cinema and that all the seats had built in little ash trays, like the ones they had on trains. 
This clip shows Peter Sellers as Mr. Martin, accountant with a firm that produces traditional Scottish tweed, trying to get rid of a newly appointed modern American bulldozer-style manager who gets on everyone's nerves and who goes too far when she suggests the company should move into synthetic fibres. Martin, having decided the only way left to him is to murder her, prepares himself by seeing a film in which a 'perfect murder' is committed, involving the use of delibererately left behind whiskey and tobacco  - the attributes which he then sets out to buy, not without difficulty as he himself doesn't  drink nor smoke...
During the scene in the cinema you can actually see other people smoke while watching the film.",10268,20,0,1,182.0,haha LOL! Great movie!

John Maybury's searing portrait of the English painter Francis Bacon (Derek Jacobi) at the height of his fame in the 1960s is one of the nastiest and most truthful portraits of the artist-as-monster ever filmed.

SLAM, starring Saul Williams, Sonja Sohn, and Bonz Malone, is a powerful work of cinema verite that portrays the story of a young black performance poet, Raymond Joshua (Saul Williams), who is arrested and imprisoned for a petty marijuana charge in a Washington, D.C. jail. Although the confining prison walls do little to shield him from danger, it is within those walls that Raymond establishes his identity, strength and voice, and meets a prison gang leader (Bonz Malone) and a prison writing teacher, Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn). Bell inspires Raymond to use the power of creative expression to free himself from the struggles and demise of the black male, as another victim of the judicial system. Sublime poetry and heart wrenching realism, SLAM is itself a testament to the importance and the impact of artistic expression. Directed by Marc Levin. Blowback Productions, 1998.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
He's good at defending himself. He's good at disguising himself. He's good at getting himself into trouble...They call him Fletch (Chevy Chase).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase added a classic comic hero to the film landscape with Fletch, one of his few truly popular star vehicles in a famously misguided post-Saturday Night Live career. Chase plays Irwin M. Fletcher, known to everyone as Fletch, a Los Angeles Lakers-loving investigative reporter with a gleeful disdain for deadlines and a knack for pushing the buttons of his frustrated editor (Richard Libertini). He's also known for donning numerous disguises and assuming zany false identities to help gain information. While pursuing an ongoing story about a powerful drug dealer who operates from Venice Beach, he comes across an intriguing offshoot in which he becomes intimately involved. Aviation executive Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) has an unusual proposition for Fletch: If Fletch agrees to an elaborate plan to kill him, for reasons Stanwyk refuses to divulge beyond explaining that he has bone cancer, Fletch will walk away with a healthy sum of money and a plane ticket to Brazil. Curious yet suspicious by profession, Fletch begins investigating Stanwyk's true motives, which leads him through numerous misadventures. Among them are a visit to a stuffy country club; a high-speed car chase with an unwitting passenger; repeat encounters with Stanwyk's wife (Dana Wheeler-Nicholson), although she may not be his only one; and a trip to Provo -- that's Utah, not Spain. Inspired by a novel of the same name by Gregory McDonald, Fletch went from thriller to comedy as it was adapted into a vehicle for Chase.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Ray (Michael Caine) uses the only thing that matters to LV -- her deceased father -- to get her to agree to playing a show.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Based on Jim Cartright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice, this screen adaptation directed by Mark Herman is an underdog film about an underdog girl named Little Voice (or LV for short). LV (Jane Horrocks from Mike Leigh's Life is Sweet who does all her own singing) is a shy, mousy woman living with her mom Mari (Secrets and Lies' Brenda Blethyn). Little Voice doesn't leave her house. Instead she sings along to her record collection of Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland, and Marilyn Monroe. Her mother Mari, however, is an outspoken woman who is convinced her sex appeal (which is little) will land her a man, especially when she's drunk. One night while bar-hopping, Mari meets the suave yet sleazy talent agent Ray Say (Michael Caine), whom she takes home for a nightcap. There Ray hears the beautiful Little Voice singing a perfect rendition of Judy Garland's ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from The Wizard of Oz. He's stunned by its beauty and thinks he can make her a star. From there the story heads in complicated, romantic, and sweet-hearted directions that should not be given away. Also starring in this small independent film is Ewan McGregor.

1365,Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985),"Any subtleties or ambiguous notions found in 1982’s First Blood are blown up real good in this 1985 sequel. Co-written by Stallone and James Cameron, the second film picks up right where the first left off as Rambo is released from prison in order to rescue a squadron of POWs in Vietnam. Directed by George Cosmatos, the explosion-happy picture benefits from stellar tech credits with TFH Guru Mark Goldblatt in the editing bay, an evocative score by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography from the brilliant Jack Cardiff.

Efficiently directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, North Dallas Forty), 1982’s First Blood is the quintessential Reagan era action film; the beleaguered Rambo takes up arms against a corrupt Washington state police department and essentially goes to war with his own government. Andrew Lazlo’s (Southern Comfort, Innerspace) beautiful cinematography (utilizing the lush landscapes of British Columbia) recalls Vilmos Zsigmond’s work on The Deer Hunter and Jerry Goldsmith’s thoughtful score conveys an appropriately manly but melancholy mood.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) and wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), decide to take it easy on Christmas and host a big family get-together. Typical of the Griswold's, however, is the disaster that results.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Chevy Chase, star of National Lampoon's Vacation and its sequel, is back as the paterfamilias of the Griswold family (including Beverly D'Angelo as his missus) to skewer the Yuletide season. Chevy mugs, trips, falls, mashes his fingers and stubs his toes as he prepares to invite numerous dysfunctional relatives to his household to celebrate Christmas. Amidst the more outrageous sight gags (including the electrocution of a cat as the Christmas tree is lit) the film betrays a sentimental streak, with old wounds healing and long-estranged relatives reuniting in the Griswold living room. National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation was still capable of attracting an audience five years after its release -- it was one of the top-rated seasonal TV specials of 1994, outrating even the first network telecast of It's a Wonderful Life.

1380,You've Got Mail (1998),"You've Got Mail (1998) / Вам Письмо (Трейлер)
Director: Nora Ephron
Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and Greg Kinnear.

Nominated for Golden Globe.

You've Got Mail is a 1998 American romantic comedy film released by Warner Bros. It is based on a manuscript of the same title written by the film's director, Nora Ephron, in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. The film is a remake of the Ernst Lubitsch film The Shop Around the Corner. (There was also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime starring Judy Garland.) You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film.

The name of the film is an example of product placement, based on the trademark greeting that AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. About one year later, AOL and Time Warner (the entertainment conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. studios, which released this film) announced a corporate merger.

The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).

Plot:
Two business rivals hate each other at the office but fall in love over the internet.

Synopsis:

In this third sequel to slasher classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, four Texas teens are abducted by a family of psychos on their way home from the senior prom. Bloodshed, torture, and intrigue ensue. Barry (Tyler Cone) and Sean (John Harrison) meet their fates quickly, but semi-bimbo Heather (Lisa Newmyer) lasts long enough to be tortured and burned before having her head cracked open like a walnut by a mechanical leg. Meanwhile, sweet, befuddled Jenny (Renee Zellweger) actively resists her captors by stealing cars, breaking through windows, and jumping off roofs. Although Leatherface (Robert Jacks), the human skin-wearing transvestite based on real-life serial killer Ed Gein, is back on board, the cannibal cast this time out also includes several new characters, from bionic villain Vilmer (Matthew McConaughey) to trashy realtor Darla (Tonie Perensky) and literature-quoting flunky W.E. (Joe Stevens). The plot also adds an X-Files-esque conspiracy to the basic Chainsaw concept in the form of deformed businessman Rothman (James Gale), who descends on the family of killers to critique their torture techniques. Written and directed by original Massacre scribe Kim Henkel, the film appeared at 1995 festivals in a 104-minute cut under the title The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre; after actors Zellweger and McConaughey became Hollywood stars, the film was re-titled, re-cut, and given a limited theatrical release in August of 1997. The nine minutes of deleted footage included scenes of Jenny's troubled home life. Both versions included brief cameos from Marilyn Burns, Paul Partain, and John Dugan -- all of whom appeared in Tobe Hooper's original film. Prodigious litigation preceded the film's re-release, although both the McConaughey and Zellweger camps denied attempting to block its release. The film's soundtrack includes a who's who of local Texas bands.

There is also footage of a younger Taylor dancing and film of the troupe performing a dozen Taylor pieces. His genius, his roots, his method of working with dancers, and his sometimes difficult nature draw the attention of those who comment.

It is one of Katt Shea best and finest work in cinema as it addresses how difficult it is to be a young woman today. It is such a true blue modern gem. When it was first released it received negative reviews which totally confused me but despite that I hold it very close to my heart as I feel it was compared unfavorably to the original rather than taken it&#39;s own merit and I even preferring it to the original. The Rage Carrie 2 was something new, fresh, unique, inventive, stylish, cool, edgy, hip, and updated such as the concept and themes. Of course it&#39;s not similar to the original which I really love as it&#39;s offering a different perspective and perception of real life issues. The movie was just constructed perfectly from the very beginning to the end. They acknowledge it as a tragic love story and for the 20th anniversary of the film Scream Factory Blu-Ray released a Collector&#39;s Edition as it&#39;s finally getting the recognition and credibility it deserves as critics and audiences are fully understanding and comprehending the interpretation of the story.😍😎💯👍"
1455,Dead Ringers (1988),"David Cronenberg’s dark-souled psychological horror film casts Jeremy Irons as Elliot and Beverly Mantle, identical twin gynecologists who make a habit of seducing their patients. Unbeknownst to these women, the twins assume each other’s identity in the bedroom as well. The sibling’s sadistic roleplaying, exacerbated by drugs and paranoia, sends their lives (and the movie) into a hellish spiral replete with typically grotesque Cronenbergian touches. Irons won the New York Film Critics award for Best Actor.

House of Frankenstein manages to make room for Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolf Man and a couple of new recruits, the mad scientist (Boris Karloff) and a demented hunchback (J. Carroll Naish). Escaping from prison, Karloff vows to continue his diabolical efforts to emulate Dr. Frankenstein's ""eternal life"" experiments; he also swears vengeance on the three men (Sig Ruman, Frank Reicher and Michael Mark) who were responsible for sending him to prison.

1512,Frankenstein (1931),"When Universal released Frankenstein in 1931 the film was a very unique piece to watch. The film has always been regarded as a black and white classic when it was nothing of the sort. When audiences originally saw the film in theatres the daylight scenes were in amber, the night in pale blue, the eerie scenes in green and the fiery climax in red. Universal also thought it was necessary to hype the film up a bit. As if the film wasnt scary enough on its own the studio found it in their best interest to park an ambulance out in front of many theatres and to keep two nurses on hand in the lobby to raise the chill factor. They even went as far as to place an actress in the audience during every showing who would, at the scariest moment in the film, scream, jump out of her seat, and run up the aisle and out of the theatre. Too bad we dont see theatrics like that anymore.",315821,491,0,82,106.0,This preview is from the rerelease in the mid 1930s. This is not the original preview from 1931.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
An unlikely relationship blossoms between the most famous actress in the world (Julia Roberts) and a charming bookkeeper (Hugh Grant) living in Notting Hill.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Can a beautiful and internationally famous American actress find happiness with a frumpy British bookstore clerk? She can -- at least for a while, it seems -- in Notting Hill. William Thacker (played by Hugh Grant) is a bookseller at a shop in the Notting Hill district in West London, who shares a house with an eccentric Welsh friend, Spike (Rhys Ifans). One day, William is minding the store when in strolls Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a lovely and well-known actress from the United States who is in London working on a film. She buys a book from William, and she is polite and charming in the way a famous actress would be with a star-struck sales clerk. Their relationship would logically end there, if William didn't run out a few minutes later to buy some juice. While dashing back to the shop, he bumps into Anna on the street, spilling juice all over her blouse. Since he lives nearby, William politely offers to let her stop by his house to clean up; since William seems harmless enough, Anna agrees. When Anna has to stop back to pick up a bag she left at William's house, they kiss -- just in time for Spike to show up. A romance slowly blooms as his friends and family (not to mention the world at large) wonder out loud what he's doing dating a movie star. Notting Hill reunites Hugh Grant with producer Duncan Kenworthy and screenwriter Richard Curtis, who previously worked together on the international hit Four Weddings And A Funeral.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Otello (Plácido Domingo) rejoices in victory with his men, and then finishes the celebration with a passionate kiss from Desdemona (Katia Ricciarelli).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Having previously staged Verdi's 1887 opera Otello at the Met and La Scala, filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli committed his production to film in 1986. Starring as the fatally jealous Moor of Venice is Placido Domingo, who had also headlined Zeffirelli's 1976 La Scala staging (production on the film was briefly interrupted while Domingo participated in the rescue operations following the Mexico City earthquake). While Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino Diaz as Iago perform their own singing, Zeffirelli's Cassio--played by real-life European prince Urbano Barberini--is dubbed by Ezio de Cesare. The director made several cuts in the original libretto and score in order to accommodate the film's two-hour time limit, but these excisions are done with taste and discretion. Because of the excessive violence in the third act--two murders, a suicide, a superficial throat-slashing--Otello was released with a PG rating.

1572,"Mission, The (1986)","This is a clip of Gabriel's Oboe from a 1986 movie, The Mission.

About Gabriel Obe (source: Wikipedia)
--------------------------------------------------------
""Gabriel's Oboe"" is the main theme for the 1986 film The Mission directed by Roland Joffé. The theme was written by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and has since been arranged and performed several times by artists such as Yo-Yo Ma, Holly Gornik, and Brynjar Hoff, among others. The theme has been called ""unforgettable"" and a ""celebrated oboe melody"". Vocalist Sarah Brightman begged Morricone to allow her to put lyrics to the theme to create her own song, ""Nella Fantasia"". In 2010, Morricone encouraged soprano Hayley Westenra to write English lyrics for ""Gabriel's Oboe"" in her album Paradiso.
The soundtrack for the film was very well received amongst critics, being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score and earning Morricone the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score.
In the film, the theme is most prominently used when the protagonist, the Jesuit Father Gabriel, walks up to a waterfall and starts playing his oboe, aiming to befriend the natives with his music so he can carry his missionary work in the New World. The Guaraní tribesmen, who have been stalking him from a distance, approach Gabriel for the first time, puzzled by the sounds of the unknown instrument. The chief of the tribe, however, is displeased by this, and breaks Gabriel's oboe. This marks the beginning of the relationship between Father Gabriel and the Guaraní natives.
Several orchestras have performed ""Gabriel's Oboe"", often under the direction of Morricone himself. The most famous renditions of the piece, other than in the movie, are probably those found in the Morricone Conducts Morricone series of concerts during the mid-2000s.
Keith and Kristyn Getty incorporated the song and blended it with their own verses with lyrics in their 2012 release ""Hymns for the Christian Life"" on track 12 ""Holy Spirit (with Gabriel's Oboe).""

About The Mission, 1986 film (source: Wikipedia)

Elizabeth Shepherd is a strong proto-Jane Austin heroine, and also plays Price's dead wife who haunts him from the grave in the form of a black cat. It's an intelligent and satisfying climax to the Corman/Poe saga.

England was such a proper place - until the day the Python arrived. Monty Python, that is, a Flying Circus that slithered up the funnybone of an entire nation and gave it fits of laughter.


Here's Monty Python's first feature film - a hilarious collection of their very best twits, skits and bits from their popular TV series. There's ""Hell's Grannies"" and ""The Cannibal Baby Strollers,"" ""The Dead Parrot"" routine (he's just resting!) and valuable tips on how to defend yourself against an attacker armed with a piece of fruit. And who will ever forget ""The Lumberjack Song"" (""I cut down trees, I wear high heels, suspenders and a bra..."")?

And, of course, plenty of zany Monty Python animation. Absolutely the silliest stuff since the day Ernest Scribbler wrote the world's funniest joke and died (croak!) laughing.

Unbeknownst to Andy, beautiful Serafine has a blood-line going back to London and happens to be the daughter of the original werewolf. But who wants to split hairs over DNA and questionable in-laws when love is at stake?

1621,Stigmata (1999),"Both controversy and psychological horror clash spiritually in the film STIGMATA starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne & Jonathan Pryce.

When Frankie Paige (Academy Award winner Patricia Arquette, True Romance, Boyhood), a young hairdresser from Pittsburgh, begins to suffer the stigmata – a physical manifestation of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion wounds – the Vatican’s top investigator, Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne, Miller’s Crossing, The Usual Suspects) is sceptical of their authenticity. However, as the severity of the wounds increases, Kiernan realises Frankie has become the vessel for an extraordinary and provocative message that threatens the very foundations of the Catholic Church, and now the stigmata is not the only thing threatening her life.  

Also starring Jonathan Pryce in a supporting role and featuring a fantastic cutting-edge score by The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan and Elia Cmíral, Stigmata is a visually stunning, intelligent supernatural horror

Ann-Margret drunkenly cavorting in a cascade of baked beans, Tommy is the
movie you've been waiting for. The Who's brilliant rock opera is sublimely
matched by director Ken Russell's penchant for cinematic excess during the
peak of his filmmaking audacity. Tommy revolves around the 'deaf, dumb, and
blind kid' (Roger Daltrey) who survives the childhood trauma that stole his
senses to become a Pinball Wizard in Pete Townshend's grandiose attack on
the hypocrisy of organised religion. Tommy's odyssey is rendered through
wall-to-wall music, from the bloodstream shock of Tina Turner to Elton John's
towering rendition of 'Pinball Wizard' and Daltrey's epiphanous rendition of
'I'm Free'. Other star performers include Eric Clapton and the Who's drummer
Keith Moon in this classic of creative rock cinema.

1673,Return with Honor (1998),"This project, twelve months in the making, is dedicated to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces as they defend our freedoms we are able to enjoy today.
When our men and women of the Armed Forces return home from combat, they are faced with many challenges, especially those with debilitating injuries, both physically and mentally. We as a Nation, support these men and women, and it is our belief that bringing honor to these American Heroes, in fact promotes healing. 
This documentary captures the unprecedented effort displayed by an organization called Warrior's Weekend of Victoria, Texas. The determination of hundreds, if not thousands of patriots from the cities of Houston and Victoria as well as other surrounding towns, is manifest in this documentary and displays their dedication and loyalty to our country and appreciation to those who serve in the military.
We have captured the blood, sweat and tears that have been shed as over 350 wounded soldiers are brought to Victoria and then on to Port O'Connor, Texas from all over the United States.
Warrior's Weekend has created a most dynamic, ""rock star"" environment as these true American heroes get a good dose of Texas hospitality. From the moment their planes land in Houston, or they board a chartered bus at Brooke Army Medical Center or Fort Hood, these men and women are overwhelmed by just how many people honor their service and sacrifice. They are greeted at Faith Family Church by local schools and several hundred more patriots. After refreshments and a quick welcome ceremony, the soldiers are led to the Field of Honor which has over 2,500 large American flags. Each flag represents an individual soldier that local businesses and individuals have purchased.  The flags also bear the names of soldiers that are currently serving or commemorate those who have served our country.  As the service men and women arrive at Port O'Connor, Texas, they are just as captivated at the sight of the highway lined with people and hundreds of American flags being flown to welcome them. Then on to the fishing docks!  There they find 226 fishing vessels set to idle as the boat captains anxiously await the arrival of their American hero. The fishermen help the soldiers board the craft and then off they go to retrieve their bounty. 
In conjunction with a weekend to be remembered by all, I believe this documentary will touch the hearts and lives of all who see it and restore the importance of honoring those who serve this wonderful country we call America.",5049,23,0,4,282.0,I want to thank everyone involved in this program  My son is on 2014  warriors week  and  to see the love and honor that is being  given to these vets    is so needed  my son has  lost has family since coming home  from Afganastan   fighting to keep his home and fighting  to just stay alive   and honestly he felt like no one cared   Ive heard him say it many times  that no one cares  this trip means so much to him and  to me his father  knowing  these young vets  are now seeing that people do care  and honor their service     I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my Heart  for this  My son called me a while ago from there  and he was over whelmed with the love  from this community and program    God Bless you all    from a Proud and thankful  father My son  needed this so bad

There’s a touch of melancholy about the duplicitous romance between Barbara Stanwyck’s luscious but two-faced card shark and Henry Fonda’s hopelessly naive beer magnate but it’s mitigated by another stellar Sturges supporting cast including the magnificent William Demarest who has the (literal) last word: “Positively the same dame!”

1700,All That Jazz (1979),"All That Jazz, director Bob Fosse’s ode to Bob Fosse, is one of the most kinetic, technically dazzling movie musicals ever made. The film, a thinly-veiled autobiography of Fosse himself, might be remembered as an ego-driven series of Fellini-esque set pieces were it not for the shrewd casting of affable, streetwise Roy Scheider as Joe Gideon, the jaded, pill-popping Lothario at the center of the film. Scheider’s innate good humor alleviates his character’s darker inclinations adding up to a memorable portrait of a charismatic megalomaniac.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
The Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) is not impressed with the RoboCop 2 prototypes.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
The serialized story structure and barbed social commentary from comic book creator and co-writer Frank Miller earned critical respect in this satirical science fiction sequel directed by Irvin Kershner. Peter Weller returns as RoboCop, a futuristic cyborg fashioned from cutting-edge technology and the biological remains of slain Detroit police officer, Alex Murphy. Still patrolling the city streets, RoboCop is scheduled by his creator, Omni Consumer Products, to be replaced by a new ""superior"" model, RoboCop 2, that according to designer Juliette Faxx (Belinda Bauer), will contain the human remains not of a cop but a criminal. In the meantime, an instantly addictive drug called Nuke is sweeping through Detroit thanks to a kingpin named Cain (Tom Noonan). Taking Cain to task, RoboCop is captured and dismantled. When he's put back together, the cyborg is reprogrammed with a series of socially conscious commands (in a sly mocking of the then relatively new concept of ""political correctness"") that render him impotent as a law enforcer. Taking charge by rewiring himself with an electrical overload, RoboCop arrests Cain, who is injured in the process. Faxx secretly takes Cain's brain and inserts it into RoboCop 2, turning the robot immediately into a law-breaking murder machine and leading to a violent showdown between two generations of robotic crime-fighters.

Conducting clandestine experiments within the morgue at Miskatonic University, scientist Herbert West (Jeffrey Combs, From Beyond) reveals to fellow graduate student Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott) his groundbreaking work concerning the re-animation of fresh corpses. West’s secret reagent is a powerful injection with the capacity to give life where there is none – destined to capture the imagination of the entire scientific community. However, between life and death is a thin thread of understanding and when obsession gets the better of West, there is no stopping his wicked ways – dead or alive!

Presented complete and uncut in gore-glistening HD with all-new special features, Re-Animator is a true horror-fest of mortal manipulation in the most demented sense.

Extremely paranoid, Carol refuses to let anyone in and never leaves the building herself, in effect breaking off all contact with the outside world. In this claustrophobic environment, she begins to lose her grip on reality, suffering from hallucinations of being attacked by a phantom rapist and hands reaching out from the walls to grab her.

Irma la Douce Trailer - Directed by Billy Wilder and starring Jack Lemmon, Jack Lemmon, Lou Jacobi, Bruce Yarnell, Herschel Bernardi. Irma la Douce is a 1963 comedy starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, directed by Billy Wilder. Though the film is not a musical, it won AndrÉ Previn an Academy Award for Best Score Adaptation or Treatment. There is also a scene in the film, in which Shirley MacLaine exclaims ""Dis-donc!"" whilst dancing on a table, which appears to be a deliberate tribute to the musical from which the film is derived. The film was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Shirley MacLaine) and Best Cinematography, Color.

Mansfield Park (1999) Official Trailer # 1- Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller Movie HD

At 10, Fanny Price, a poor relation, goes to live at Mansfield Park, the estate of her aunt's husband, Sir Thomas. Clever, studious, and a writer with an ironic imagination and fine moral compass, she becomes especially close to Edmund, Thomas's younger son. Fanny is soon possessed of beauty as well as a keen mind and comes to the attention of a neighbor, Henry Crawford. Thomas promotes this match, but to his displeasure, Fanny has a mind of her own, asking Henry to prove himself worthy. As Edmund courts Henry's sister and as light shines on the link between Thomas's fortunes and New World slavery, Fanny must assess Henry's character and assert her heart as well as her wit.

A grisly homicide. . . a sensational trial. . . a forbidden affair.
It's JAGGED EDGE, a razor-sharp suspense thriller about crime,
punishment and passion. Jeff Bridges is the prime suspect
and Glenn Close plays the attorney who falls in love
with him. When a San Francisco socialite is viciously
murdered, her publisher-husband, Jack Forrester (Bridges),
is accused of committing the crime. Teddy Barnes (Close)
decides to defend the charming, manipulative Jack,
only to disregard legal ethics by having an affair
with him. With the help of private eye
Sam Ransom (Robert Loggia), she takes
on a ruthless D.A. (Peter Coyote) who's
using the case as a political steppingstone.
However, a startling revelation puts
Teddy in jeopardy of becoming the next
victim of the JAGGED EDGE.",153036,369,0,58,115.0,"Pellicola molto bella, certo nulla di eccezionale ma è comunque un piacevole giallo, ci sono degli errori, quando sta testimoniando e Krasni e Barnes stanno discutendo, il giudice dice &quot;Ci vediamo entrambi nelle mie stanze!&quot; e si alza e lascia l&#39;aula. L&#39;ufficiale giudiziario non chiama &quot;tutti si alzano&quot; e nessuno in aula si alza. Ciò si verifica più volte durante il processo, quindi molto bella e molto bella per me come valutazione è 7,5."

1794,Flawless (1999),"From director Michael Radford comes Flawless, a diamond-heist thriller set in swinging 1960s London. Demi Moore plays Laura Quinn, a bright, driven and beautiful executive at the London Diamond Corporation who finds herself frustrated by a glass ceiling after years of faithful employment, as man after man is promoted ahead of her despite her greater experience. Michael Caine is Hobbs, the nighttime janitor at London Diamond who is virtually invisible to the executives that work there, but over the years has amassed a startling amount of knowledge about how the company runs. Hobbs has his own bone to pick with London Diamond. Observing Lauras frustration, he convinces her to help him execute an ingenious plan to steal a hefty sum in diamonds. But unbeknownst to Laura, Hobbs plans go even farther than hes let on, and together they set in motion a thrilling heist of dizzying proportions, the likes of which London has never seen.

Σύνοψη
Ένα ταξίδι αναψυχής μετατρέπεται σε εφιάλτη όταν δύο φίλοι παίρνουν με ωτο-στοπ έναν ψυχοπαθή κατάδικο ο οποίος τους ανακοινώνει ότι στο τέλος του ταξιδιού θα τους σκοτώσει. Σαν να μην έφτανε αυτό, η ιδιαιτερότητα που έχει στο ένα μάτι του το οποίο μένει μόνιμα ανοικτό, δεν τους αφήνει να γνωρίζουν πότε κοιμάται και πότε είναι ξύπνιος. Το ωτο-στοπ του Τρόμου είναι το πρώτο φιλμ νουαρ  σκηνοθετημένο από γυναίκα το 1953.
Φιλμ νουάρ είναι κινηματογραφικός όρος που χρησιμοποιείται κυρίως για να ορίσει ένα συγκεκριμένο στυλ σε αστυνομικές ταινίες του Χόλιγουντ που δίνουν έμφαση στον κυνισμό των χαρακτήρων και τα συναισθηματικά - ερωτικά τους κίνητρα. Η κλασική περίοδος του φιλμ νουάρ στις ΗΠΑ εκτείνεται από τις αρχές της δεκαετίας του '40 μέχρι το τέλος της δεκαετίας του '50. Οι ταινίες αυτής της εποχής χαρακτηρίζονται από χαμηλό φωτισμό και έντονες ασπρόμαυρες αντιθέσεις, επιρροές από το γερμανικό εξπρεσιονισμό. Επίσης, πληθώρα ιστοριών και συμπεριφορών χαρακτήρων προέρχονται από το χώρο του αστυνομικού μυθιστορήματος στις ΗΠΑ κατά την περίοδο της Οικονομικής Ύφεσης.

1839,"Last Detail, The (1973)","A 1973 film starring Jack Nicholson, directed by Hal Ashby (Shampoo).  Also featuring Otis Young and a very young Randy Quaid.  Very, very funny with an undertone of seriousness that catches up to the main characters by the end of the film.  Nicholson is fantastic, as usual, but it's one of his smaller films that was immediately overshadowed by ""Chinatown"" and ""Cuckoo's Nest"" that followed in the next two years, respectively.  At the time of the film's release, it was a huge success and Nicholson's performance was regarded highly.  Columbia then pulled the film from release, rereleasing it closer to Oscar time, but any buzz that had been generated had worn off by that time.  Still, Nicholson was nominated as was Robert Towne, the great screenwriter, and Randy Quaid for Best Supporting Actor.  Based on the novel by Darryl Ponicsan.

1847,American Flyers (1985),"American Flyers takes you on the road for exciting world-class cycling competition as two brothers struggle to win a race and to regain the respect and affection they once shared. Achievement-oriented Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a nationally-ranked cyclist. Younger brother David (David Grant) is a drifter, content to cruise through life on a 10-speed. Time-and the painful events surrounding their father's death-have turned the siblings' differences into an open rift. So they try to bridge the gap by competing together in the Hell of the West, a grueling race through the Rocky Mountains. For the first time ever, the brothers train and race side-by-side...while each privately confronts a nagging fear: the congenital ailment that struck down their father could just suddenly strike one of them. Writer Steve Tesich, and Academy Award winner for his bike-racing opus Breaking Away, now captures the sport's excitement on an even larger scale. Against the backdrop of the Coors International Classic, the U.S.'s largest, most prestigious race, Tesich and director John Badham craft a dazzling, spirit-soaring spectacle. Says Rex Reed: ""You'll go away feeling good! American Flyers is a fine mixture of romance, humor and tears with action sequences among the most exciting ever captured on film.""

Successful mystery novelist Janet Frobisher, who has been separated for years from her husband, a man with a criminal past, lives in an isolated home in England. Her nearest neighbour is nosy veterinarian Dr. Henderson. Janet falls in love and occasionally dabbles with her secretary Chris' fiancé, Larry, who is years younger than she. When her estranged husband unexpectedly appears, Janet poisons him by administering horse medication given to her by her neighbour. One of the deceased man's criminal cohorts arrives as she's preparing to dispose of the body in the local lake. When Frobisher's secretary and Larry arrive at the secluded house, the mysterious man, who has assisted her with her scheme, impersonates the long-absent spouse of Janet, who plots to get rid of her unplanned accomplice, as well.",14030,88,0,9,92.0,I love this movie

HOWARDS END - 2016 4k Restoration
Directed by James Ivory
Written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson

One of Merchant Ivory’s undisputed masterpieces, this adaptation of E.M. Forster’s classic 1910 novel is a saga of class relations and changing times in Edwardian England. Margaret Schlegel (Emma Thompson) and her sister Helen (Helena Bonham Carter) become involved with two couples: a wealthy, conservative industrialist (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife (Vanessa Redgrave), and a working-class man (Samuel West) and his mistress (Niccola Duffet). The interwoven fates and misfortunes of these three families and the diverging trajectories of the two sisters’ lives are connected to the ownership of Howards End, a beloved country home. A compelling, brilliantly acted study of one woman’s struggle to maintain her ideals and integrity in the face of Edwardian society’s moribund conformist values.

1883,Of Mice and Men (1992),"Of Mice and Men is a 1992 American film starring John Malkovich and Gary Sinise, directed and produced by Gary Sinise. It is the third movie adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1937 novel of the same name. The first adaptation was made in 1939, and a made-for-TV movie version was produced in 1981. It was released on October 2, 1992 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures.

George Milton (Gary Sinise) is in a train boxcar, reminiscing upon the events that have just happened. He thinks back to when he and his companion Lennie Small (John Malkovich), who has learning difficulties and the mentality of a small child, are fleeing from their previous employment in Weed. They were run out of town after Lennie was accused of attempted rape when he touched and held onto a young woman's pretty dress (prompted by his love of stroking soft things). After running from Weed, George and Lennie are trying to attain their shared dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream, which he never tires of hearing George describe, is merely to have soft rabbits on the farm, which he can pet. The two go to work at a ranch named Tyler Ranch.

At the ranch, the dream appears to move closer to reality. Candy (Ray Walston), the aged, one-handed ranch-hand, offers to pitch in with Lennie and George so they can buy the farm. The dream disappears when Lennie accidentally kills the young and attractive wife (Sherilyn Fenn) of Curley (Casey Siemaszko), the ranch owner's son, while trying to stroke her hair. A lynch mob led by Curley gathers. Realizing he is doomed to a life of loneliness and despair like the rest of the migrant workers, and wanting to spare Lennie a painful death at the hands of the vengeful and violent Curley, George shoots Lennie in the back of the head before the mob can find him. The film comes to a close with the opening scene of George reminiscing in the train boxcar. The last minute of the movie depicts another memory: George and Lennie working together.",417504,828,0,376,143.0,Was introduction voice of Optimus prime as Peter Cullen!?

1892,"Beach, The (2000)","An adaptation of Alex Garland's acclaimed novel, The Beach is a movie about a backpacker named Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his quest to find the ultimate paradise.  Disgusted with the inauthenticity of common society, Richard treks across Asia while avoiding all tourist settings at all costs.  In a shoddy Bangkok hotel, Richard meets a man who appears to be insane and calls himself Daffy.  Daffy tells Richard of a paradise unlike any other; a paradise in its purest form, untouched by humans exploiting nature.  When Richard awakens to find a crudely drawn map and that Daffy had killed himself, he decides to embark on a journey to find this paradise lagoon.  The Beach features a strong isolated island atmosphere and plenty of gorgeous scenery and backdrops.  The plot starts somewhat like an adventure romance but becomes increasingly more unorthodox until a climatic ending that breaks any stereotype it may have set earlier in the movie.

The movie documents the Apollo missions - perhaps the most definitively of any movie under two hours. Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary, Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time ""for all mankind.""

1929,Never Cry Wolf (1983),"Check out my list on IMDb called ""Quiet, Personal Movies"": https://www.imdb.com/list/ls538743545/

This is the second film directed by the great Carroll Ballard. Like his first film, ""The Black Stallion"" (1979), it also deals with themes of isolation and human/animal relationships. Utilizing stunning cinematography and music, this is a grand adventure in the far north. Based on Farley Mowat's semi-autobiography of the same name, it tells about a man sent to uncover the reason behind the decline of caribou herds.

This is my favorite film of all time.

Sore throat, burning sensation in the nose and throat, and nasal congestion are symptoms of upper airways irritation. Upper airways irritation most likely takes place if formaldehyde levels exceed 1 ppm. Cough, phlegm and shortness of breath are symptoms of upper airways irritation. Lower airways irritation most likely takes place if formaldehyde levels exceed 5 ppm. Individuals with pre-existing asthma has a higher sensitivity when exposed to formaldehyde. In the case of formaldehyde levels exceed 50 ppm, it can result in pneumonia, chronic bronchitis or even death.<br><br>Vision Disorder<br><br>Eyes are relatively more sensitive to the formaldehyde. Concentration of this substance above 0,03 ppm to 0,5 ppm may cause burning sensation, itching, tearing and redness. In the case of formaldehyde levels exceed 100 ppm or someone’s eyes get in direct contact with it, the result is severe optical injuries. Loss of vision is the worst effect.<br><br>Skin Irritation<br><br>Formaldehyde Direct contact with formaldehyde liquid can cause irritation, like rash and hives. Excessive exposure to formaldehyde is also reported to cause allergic contact dermatitis. Fabrics are widely treated with formaldehyde-contained products, which increase the probability of skin irritation for some individuals who are prone to formaldehyde-induced allergy.<br><br>Intestine Damages<br><br>In the case of formaldehyde being swallowed, it can cause severe damages in the stomach. The symptoms are nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Furthermore, it can develop damage on other organs including kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen. United States Departmen of Labor reports that ingestion liquid of as little as 30 ml contains 37 percent formaldehyde can lead to death.<br>Here are some actions to execute to individual who suffers from those conditions:<br><br>In respiratory disorder cases, if the victims are still able to walk, take them to an area with fresh air. Victims who are unable to walk, should be removed carefully and seek for medical treatment as soon as possible;<br><br>In eyes disorder cases, irrigate them carefully with plain water or saline for 20 minutes;<br><br>In skin irritation cases, wash the contaminated areas thoroughly with plain water for 4 to 6 minutes. Use soap if available. Remove the victims’ clothing as it may also be contaminated with formaldehyde;<br><br>In case of ingesting formaldehyde, victims who are still conscious should be given 100 to 200 mililiters of milk.<br><br>Long Term Effects and How To Deal With It<br>An experiment on rats was held in 1980 to observe the effects of formaldehyde exposure. The experiment showed that constant high amount of formaldehyde exposure could develop nosecancer in rats. There has been several studies of formaldehyde effects on human’s health, but resulting in diverse conclusions. No scientific research showed at what level formaldehyde exposure can lead to cancer. Still, some institutions in America such as Enviromental Protection Agency, International Agency for Research on Cancer, and Department of Health and Human Services, has classified formaldehyde as a reasonable human carcinogen under prolonged excessive exposure.<br>To reduce the risk of formaldehyde-induced diseases in the long term, there are some actions to do as preventive measures:<br><br>BILL666GATES DEPOLUATION SCAM oh SORRY SCUM PLANDEMSICK<br>Formaldehyde<br><br>Formaldehyde, a chemical typically present in the human body, is a product of healthy digestive function.<br>In high doses, formaldehyde is toxic and potentially lethal.

But, for many reasons, thimerosal contained in vaccines <br>REALLY.... MERCURY IS A KILLER<br>Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth&#39;s crust, air, soil and water. Since the earth&#39;s formation, volcanic eruptions, weathering of rocks and burning of coal have caused mercury to be released into the environment. Once released, certain types of bacteria in the environment can change mercury to methylmercury. Methylmercury makes its way through the food chain in fish, animals and humans. At high levels, it can be toxic to people.<br>Thimerosal contains a different form of mercury called ethylmercury. Studies comparing ethylmercury and methylmercury suggest that they are processed differently in the human body. Ethylmercury is broken down and excreted much more rapidly than methylmercury. Therefore, ethylmercury (the type of mercury in the influenza vaccine) is much less likely than methylmercury (the type of mercury in the environment) to accumulate in the body and cause harm."

1984,Red Dawn (1984),"Trailer for the 1984 classic Red Dawn.  Avenge Me, WOLVERINES!

It is the dawn of World War III. In mid-western America, a group of teenagers bands together to defend their town, and their country, from invading Soviet forces.

From out of the sky, Soviet, Nicaraguan, and Cuban troops begin landing on the football field of a Colorado high school. In seconds, the paratroopers have attacked the school and sent a group of teenagers fleeing into the mountains. Armed only with hunting rifles, pistols, and bows and arrows, the teens struggle to survive the bitter winter and the Soviet KGB patrols hunting for them. Eventually, trouble arises when they kill a group of Soviet soldiers on patrol in the highlands. Soon they will wage their own guerrilla warfare against the invading Soviet troops-under the banner of 'Wolverines!'

Starring Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Powers Boothe, Harry Dean Stanton. Directed by John Milius.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Longtime neighbors and rivals John (Jack Lemmon) and Max (Walter Matthau) chase after the same woman (Ann-Margret).

FILM DESCRIPTION:
This cheerful holiday comedy, a surprise box office smash, featured a generous dollop of raunchy, crude humor and was greatly elevated by the presence of masterful performers in the lead roles. Jack Lemmon is John Gustafson, an ice-fishing Minnesota native who has been feuding with his neighbor and former best friend Max Goldman (Walter Matthau) for decades. The battle of wills between John and Max is characterized by crude name calling and harmless practical jokes. Max is unaware that John is having serious problems, chiefly that his daughter Melanie (Daryl Hannah) is experiencing marital woes and that his house is about to be confiscated by an officious IRS agent (Buck Henry). When it seems that John and Max may finally put aside their childish rivalry, however, sexy new neighbor Ariel (Ann-Margret) arrives and dates both men, pitting them against each other more fiercely than ever before. Despite their mutual loathing, the death of a friend, John's problems, and a budding romance between Max's son Jacob (Kevin Pollak) and Melanie may force the two old friends to reconcile.

1993,Blood and Sand (Sangre y Arena) (1989),"""Blood and Sand"" stars a ravishing Sharon Stone in a memorable pre-""Basic Instinct"" vamp role.
Previously filmed in 1922 featuring Rudolph Valentino and in 1940 with Tyrone Power, Vicente Blasco Ibanez's mystical bullfight novel Blood & Sand was given a third big-screen treatment in this 1989 Jose Frade Spanish production. In addition to Stone, it casts American actor Christopher Rydell as the bullfighter hero Juan Gallardo. Her role was previously essayed in 1922 by Nita Naldi and in 1940 by Rita Hayworth. The story remains the same: a dirt-poor youth rises to fame and fortune in the bull ring, forgets his roots, cheats on his wife, has a last-minute change of heart, and pays for his sins in grotesque fashion.
The story revolves around the young, talented, and naturally gifted torero Juan Gallardo. Gallardo wants to be popular in bull fighting. His love Carmen has a cousin who has left home with Gallardo for a bullfighting competition. After a bull charges the neophyte Gallardo, his friend intercepts and saves Gallardo at the cost of his own life.
A despondent Gallardo runs away and meets Lady Dona Sol (played by Stone), a beautiful, rich lady, who offers him a job to work her fields. However, Gallardo insists on becoming a superstar in bull fighting in his country, and, on the advice of a security guard, he joins the famous bull fighting trainer, Nacional. Nacional trains and prepares Gallardo for competition.

2001,Dersu Uzala (1975),"Dersu Uzala is often considered to be one of Kurosawa's finest films, and should be a must see for any dedicated movie-goer.

This scene is probably the most memorable from the film. The captain and his guide, Dersu, find themselves separated from the rest of their men and lost in the deep Siberian tundra. There, in order to survive, they have to build a shelter of straw before the night falls over the land. It is a breathtaking (literally) scene, with a lot more quality than any Spielberg or Bay-movie that tend to crowd the cinemas nowadays.

I'm sorry about the video quality, it could have been a lot better. I hope though that you'll manage to enjoy the view anyhow! It actually turns out quite good in fullscreen. Also there are no subtitles to this, so delight in the atmosphere and beauty instead. ;)",72300,356,0,40,597.0,❤❤

2008,"Bamba, La (1987)","Born to Poverty. Destined for Stardom.  He lived the American Dream.

The life of rock & roll legend Ritchie Valens bursts across the screen in the highly celebrated music-filled biopic La Bamba, starring Lou Diamond Phillips (Young Guns, Che) as the teenage sensation whose rise to fame was tragically cut short at the age of 17.

Phillips gives an electrifying performance as Valens, who has to contend with racial prejudice, a jealous brother (a stunningly intense Esai Morales, NYPD Blue, Caprica) and an overbearing mother, before his unique style of Latino-influenced rock & roll rockets him to fame, but sets him on the path for an unavoidable date with destiny. 

Featuring music from Grammy Award winning rock band Los Lobos, and also starring Elizabeth Peña (Jacob’s Ladder, Down and Out in Beverly Hills), director Luis Valdez’s La Bamba is an irresistibly toe-tapping depiction of the early days of American rock music, and the indelible influence one young man had upon it. Eureka Entertainment is proud to present the film on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK in a 30th Anniversary Digitally Restored Dual Format Edition.

In a hilarious homage to the music scene, Rob and the wacky, offbeat clerks that inhabit his store expound on the intricacies of life and song all the while trying to succeed in their adult relationships. Are they listening to pop music because they are miserable? Or are they miserable because they listen to pop music? This romantic comedy provides a whimsical glimpse into the male view of the affairs of the heart.

In this film, directed by Ted Kotcheff (The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz), the National Football League is revealed to be more about the money than the game. Nick Nolte is North Dallas Bulls pass-catcher Phillip Elliott, whose cynicism and independent spirit is looked upon as troublesome by team coaches Johnson (Charles Durning) and Strothers (G.D. Spradlin) and team owner Conrad Hunter (Steve Forrest). Elliot, at the end of his career and wise to the way players are bought and sold like cattle, goes through the games pumped up on painkillers conveniently provided by the management. His teammates include savvy quarterback Maxwell (Mac Davis) and lunk-headed defensive lineman Jo Bob Priddy (Bo Svenson), who deal with the impersonality and back-biting of the game through off-field diversions. When the Bulls management benches Elliot after manipulating him to help train a fellow teammate, Elliot has to decide whether there is more to life than the game that he loves.

A rare atmospheric phenomenon allows a New York City firefighter to communicate with his son 30 years in the future via short-wave radio. The son uses this opportunity to warn the father of his impending death in a warehouse fire, and manages to save his life. However, what he does not realize is that changing history has triggered a new set of tragic events, including the murder of his mother. The two men must now work together, 30 years apart, to find the murderer before he strikes so that they can change history--again.

If given a fair chance, it is very enjoyable, and features great acting, production, and a good plot overall. Robert Shaw and Harrison Ford have co-starring leads, with Ford being fresh from the role that made him a household name--Han Solo in STAR WARS. Ford portrays American Ranger Lt. Col. Mike Barnsby, the leader of a commando unit sent to Yugoslavia to destroy a vital bridge that will allow Nazi forces to move into Partisan territory. Shaw's character is Major Mallory, who joins Barnsby's unit but has a mission of his own: seek out and elminate a double agent operating with the Yugoslavian resistance fighters. This movie is also of note because it marked Robert Shaw's final film appearance. He died of a heart attack shortly after finishing the project.

Desperate for a hit after the flop of Sweet Charity, director Bob Fosse rode herd on the cast, especially Joel Grey, who originated the role of the creepy Kit Kat Klub emcee on Broadway but almost lost his Oscar-winning part in the movie to Fosse’s initial choice… Ruth Gordon. At one point Fosse spitefully reduced all Grey’s musical numbers to snippets (the producers put it all back). The finished movie won eight Oscars including Best Director for Fosse and Best Actress for star Liza Minnelli, who never had a better role. Christopher Isherwood’s “Berlin Stories”, which introduced the character of Sally Bowles, had been filmed as a straight drama in 1955 under the title I Am a Camera.

Held Up (1999) Official Trailer #1 - Jamie Foxx Movie HD

While they're on vacation in the Southwest, Rae finds out her man Michael spent their house money on a classic car, so she dumps him, hitching a ride to Vegas for a flight home. A kid promptly steals Michael's car, leaving him at the Zip & Sip, a convenience store. Three bumbling robbers promptly stage a hold up. Two take off with the cash stranding the third, with a mysterious crate, just as the cops arrive. The robber takes the store hostage. As incompetent cops bring in a SWAT team and try a by-the-book rescue, Michael has to keep the robber calm, find out what's in the crate, aid the negotiations, and get back to Rae. The Stockholm Syndrome asserts its effect.

Anchors Aweigh Trailer - Directed by George Sidney and starring Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, Gene Kelly, JosÉ Iturbi, Dean Stockwell. Two sailors, one naive, the other experienced in the ways of the world, on liberty in Los Angeles, is the setting for this movie musical.

A less drastic tack is taken by the heroes of Bruce Kessler's drive-in situation comedy: they pretend to be gay, and have to keep up the pretense while trying to date girls on the side. The expected stereotypes abound, but all looks pretty goofy and innocuous today. Some in the LGBT community consider it progressive for its time. A bikini-clad Candice Rialson can be glimpsed in a bit part on her way to B-movie stardom.

2074,Gypsy (1962),"Gypsy (1962) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #Gypsy

Ringing with the showbiz sass of its Jule Styne/Stephen Sondheim score, the film version of the Broadway hit Gypsy takes you on a grand vaudeville tour. It sweeps you up in the roller-coaster relationship of Louise (Natalie Wood), the wallflower later to blossom into sophisticated stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, and her ambitious mother, Rose (Rosalind Russell who's performance won her a fifth Best Actress Golden Globe Award). Karl Malden scores as Herbie, the salesman who falls for Rose - to his exasperation. Full of terrific tunes (Everything's Coming Up Roses and Small World among them), Gypsy will certainly entertain you and definitely make you smile.

Special Features: 2 Outtake Musical Numbers: You'll Never Get Away from Me (Duet Version) and Together Wherever We Go.

Directed By Mervyn LeRoy
Starring Rosalind Russell, Natalie Wood, Karl Malden

Directed and written by Barbara Sonneborn
Featuring Xuan Ngoc Nguyen, Barbara Sonneborn

""The cumulative effect of superbly integrated interviews and archival footage is staggering, easily as terrifying as anything found in Saving Private Ryan...wisely allows the ravaged faces and grainy footage of dead children to speak for themselves.""   
— Variety

Regret to Inform superbly portrays the lasting devastation of the Vietnam War as seen through the eyes of women, both American and Vietnamese, who lost their husbands. This is the story of one woman's journey to Vietnam, twenty years after her husband was killed there, and the women she encounters who were affected by the war.

READ MORE....

Hoping to find some closure for her pain and loss, Barbara Sonneborn wants to see and feel the places where her husband spent his last days. By intercutting emotional testimonials from women on both sides of the war who share their suffering, she makes us understand how real this war remains. Through seeing many different women's perspectives, we recognize how their emotions contrasted: helplessness on the part of those in the United States versus inevitable participation by North and South Vietnamese women.

A very powerful, yet quiet, film, Regret to Inform develops a yet-unseen perspective: that of those left behind. Focused on Vietnamese and American women, the film is filled with exceptional interviews which are revealing and poignant. Testimony to Sonneborn 's uncommon ability is the remarkable level of honesty and openness the women are willing to share on camera. The viewer is taken on an uncommonly well-crafted journey, which includes beautiful camerawork and a seamless mixture of new and archival footage. Deeply personal and vastly universal, Regret to Inform is an involving and moving lesson about the painful legacy of war.

REVIEWS

""Regret To Inform may claim an unusual point of view, but the anguish it uncovers is familiar from numerous previous accounts of the war. That it's the same tragic story however you come at it may in fact be the most enlightening aspect of this film.""   — Village Voice

""While recognizing that war has its heroic aspect - witness the fortitude and resilience of the widows - [Regret to Inform] also implies that the terrible price of that nobility is one that nobody should have to pay.""  — New York Times

""Unlike the traditional documentary that seeks to impart information and keep emotion largely in check, Regret to Inform is frankly personal and explicitly emotional.""  — San Francisco Chronicle

2139,Near Dark (1987),"For her second film, director Kathryn Bigelow's original intention had been to make a revisionist western, but when it became apparent nobody was funding horse operas in 1987 she and co-writer Eric Red decided to turn their project into a genre hybrid--a vampire western. Aside from Curse of the Undead (1959), Billy the Kid Meets Dracula and Jesse James vs. Frankenstein's Daughter (both 1966), that concept had been pretty much unexplored.  Box office returns were unexciting, but it found an appreciative audience on video. A modern remake co-written by Bigelow started shooting in 2007 but remains uncompleted, having been put on hold due to its similarity to the Twilight series.

Battleship Potemkin  
Synopsis
For eight decades, Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 masterpiece has remained one of the most influential silent films of all time. This all-new restoration -- available for the first time in 35mm -- restores dozens of missing shots, all 146 title cards, and Edmund Meisel's definitive 1926 score, returning the film to a form as close to its creator's bold vision as has been seen since the film's triumphant Moscow premiere.

2161,F/X (1986),"F/X (also known as or subtitled Murder by Illusion) is a 1986 American action-thriller film about Rollie Tyler (Bryan Brown), an expert in the art of special effects (F/X) with a reputation built by his work on many low-budget hack-and-slash films such as I Dismember Mama. The Department of Justice hires him to stage the murder of a gangster about to enter the Witness Protection Program. He agrees, but then things get complicated. Meanwhile, New York City police detective Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy) is investigating the faked murder and cannot understand why the Justice Department is even less helpful than usual. [1]

2171,On Our Merry Way (1948),"This was a real curio of a movie... James ""Slim"" Stewart and Henry Fonda were long time friends and roommates in NYC in their halcyon Broadway stage days, and here they are together in 1948 in a nearly forgotten little comedy called ""On Our Merry Way"", an episodic comedy tied together with Burgess Meredith's character playing a reporter doing a story about Children. In this scene Hank and Jimmy are musicians traveling with a ragtag band in a beat up old bus. Down on their luck they happen on an aspiring horn player (Played here by Carl ""alfalfa"" Switzer, who had a tiny role 2 years earlier with Jimmy Stewart in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as a  Mischeivous high school kid who opens up the dance floor to drop the dancing kids into the swimming pool~!)  
 
Here, Carl plays a young ""Hepcat"" who dreams of a life traveling with such a band. 
Dig his way-out rendition of ""You must have been a beautiful Baby"" as he plays along with the great Harry James. ""Beat me, Daddy!""
Stewart and Fonda are way too ""unhep"" to be real Jazz bohos, and it's still too early in 1948 to give much creedence to the new Jazz phenomenon called BeBop. They play a safe, watered down form of Swing. Yet, it is still a pleasure to see these real life pals onscreen together (in spite of their growing postwar political differences) at the young ages of 40 and 43. James Stewart would never seem this young again.
 
 
Here's another segment of the 1948 film that shows Fred MacMurray in an early comedic role along side his future TV costar in ""My Three Sons"", William Demarest, who would play Uncle Charlie 12 years later for the duration of the show (after a season with William Frawley, of course). Fred started out as a leading man only to discover he had a gift for light comedy. Look at his adroit handling of these magic tricks. Although MacMurray and Fonda starred together in their earliest roles, the Technicolor film, ""trail  of the Lonesome Pine"", it's too bad Fred and his real life friend James Stewart weren't in any scenes together in this one. Their's might have been a cinematic teaming that could have really thrived!

Thus, when approached by local sheriff Michael Rivers (J.T. Walsh) with a request that he try to get through to an autistic nine-year-old boy Tim Warden (Ben Faulkner), who likely witnessed and possibly committed the double murder of his parents, he initially demurs. 

However, he puts aside his reservations after hearing that another psychologist, Dr. Harlinger (John Lithgow), intends to drug the boy into revealing the truth. When police entered the murder scene, they had found, along with the bloody victims, the boy brandishing a knife, and his teenaged sister Sylvie (Liv Tyler), cowering in the closet. 

Since the girl saw nothing, Rainer begins to work slowly and patiently with this boy who has never spoken, using a method based on the fact that the the autistic mind thinks in terms of rote sequences. He also gains the trust of the haunted Sylvie, and gradually the children unfold their tale of terror.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Chick (Bud Abbot) and Wilbur (Lou Costello) accidentally awaken Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Wolf Man.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
It seems that Count Dracula (Bela Lugosi), in league with a beautiful but diabolical lady scientist (Lenore Aubert), needs a ""simple, pliable"" brain with which to reactivate Frankenstein's creature (Glenn Strange). The ""ideal"" brain belongs to the hapless Lou Costello, whom the lady doctor woos to gain his confidence and lure him to the operating table. Lawrence Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), better known as the Wolf Man, arrives on the scene to warn Costello and his pal Bud Abbott of Dracula's nefarious schemes. Throughout the film, the timorous Costello witnesses the nocturnal rituals of Dracula and the Monster, but can't convince the ever-doubting Abbott--until the wild climax in Dracula's castle, where the comedians are pursued by all three of the film's monstrosities. As a bonus, the Invisible Man (voiced by an unbilled Vincent Price) shows up for ""all the excitement.""

http://www.youtube.com/user/FoxMovies",54023,251,0,10,99.0,This is still a great movie.  Most Americans didn&#39;t think the way Gordon Gekko did.  That&#39;s why they were not wealthy.  I&#39;m not saying people should try to do something illegal to become wealthy.  There was still something to admire about Gordon Gekko before he became so greedy and corrupt.  At least he knew how to enrich himself.  He wasn&#39;t the type of person who wanted everything in the world.  Most Americans were spending everything they had during the 80s.  They didn&#39;t worry about all that spending until the 90s.  &quot;You got ninety percent of the American public out there with little or no net worth.&quot; -- Gordon Gekko

I dialoghi ambientano la scena durante l&#39;amministrazione Carter (1977-81), ma le lattine per bevande con il disegno affusolato non sono state introdotte fino al 1987, quindi bella e bella per me come valutazione è 7."

Super fascinating. I appreciate Ed Harris&#39; story telling - he didn&#39;t try to glamorize or hide any of Pollock&#39;s character defects and the movie ends the same way Pollock&#39;s story ended too. I liked how it ended - it wasn&#39;t fluffed or made to be overly tragic or artsy-fartsy...it was just... sad and unfortunate. Pollock would&#39;ve approved, it was rough around the edges just like he was. I hadn&#39;t realized he died in this way. Any excuse to watch an Ed Harris movie and I&#39;m in, not sure what took me so long to see this one. Would recommend! I didn&#39;t want it to end..."

Before Night Falls (2000) Official Trailer - Javier Bardem, Johnny Depp Movie 

Episodic look at the life of Cuban poet and novelist, Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990), from his childhood in Oriente province to his death in New York City. He joins Castro's rebels. By 1964, he is in Havana. He meets the wealthy Pepe, an early lover; a love-hate relationship lasts for years. Openly gay behavior is a way to spite the government. His writing and homosexuality get him into trouble: he spends two years in prison, writing letters for other inmates and smuggling out a novel. He befriends Lázaro Gomes Garriles, with whom he lives stateless and in poverty in Manhattan after leaving Cuba in the Mariel boat-lift. When asked why he writes, he replies cheerfully, ""Revenge.""

The Family Man Trailer - Directed by Brett Ratner and starring Nicolas Cage, Don Cheadle, Jeremy Piven, Saul Rubinek, Josef Sommer. Cutthroat investment banker Jack Campbell, who eschews emotional ties, is transported into the prosaic life he might have had if he'd wed his college sweetheart.

With the goal of securing her promotion, Lily ventures into the most isolated areas of the mountains to collect the songs and finds herself increasingly enchanted - not only by the rugged purity of the music, but also by the raw courage and endurance of the local people as they carve out meaningful lives against the harshest conditions.

The United States armed forces were at their highest state of readiness ever and Soviet field commanders in Cuba were prepared to use battlefield nuclear weapons to defend the island if it was invaded. Luckily, thanks to the bravery of two men, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, war was averted. 

The year is 1962. USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba. The Chiefs of Staff warns President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases, crippling the U.S. ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion. Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba, whether by diplomatic means or by force.

* Plot:
Lincoln High's A-Cheerleading Squad is your typical group of mall-going, pizza-eating, boy-chasing 21st century American teenagers living on the edge of perfection. Sure, each member has her foibles. Diane, the captain of the squad who is madly in love with Lincoln High star quarterback Jack Bartlett, has nuclear-powered enthusiasm. Hannah is righteously born-again. Kansas, the rebel whose mother is doing time in the local prison, can't help but talk trashy. Lucy is a geek obsessed with going to Harvard. And Cleo has fantasies of stalking Conan O'Brien. High school is mostly heaven for these paragons of teenage bliss - until Jack and Diane find themselves in an unexpected adult situation, and in desperate need of extra cash. In order to help their friend Diane, the A-Squad goes where no cheerleader has gone before: taking on a little after-school project known as bank robbery. But like five Bonnies without a Clyde, the A-Squad does things their way - with a little sugar and a lot of spice.

2339,Big Shots (1987),"Big Shots (1987) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #BigShots

Ivan Reitman, producer of National Lampoon's Animal House and producer/director of Ghostbusters, brings you Big Shots, a slam-bang comedy-adventure with a heart as big as Chicago. It centers on the unlikely but very special friendship that develops between two 11-year-old boys. Obie is a kid from the lily-white suburbs struggling with the recent death of his father while Scam is a product of the inner city, streetwise but equally alone. Together they share an odyssey full of outrageous humor and riveting excitement that teaches them that it's character and love, note size, age or stature, that truly makes someone a big shot.

Robert Mandel, director of FIX, has give Big Shots a percolating rhythm that maintains a deft balance between the story's scares and surprises and its warm, knowing exploration of two boys on the brink of manhood. With a sterling supporting cast, this is a film the whole family will enjoy.

Starring Ricky Busker, Darius McCrary, Robert Joy

PLOT:
The story returns to the Brody family in Amity Island. Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his widow, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary), claims that ""it was the fear [of the shark] that killed him."" She discusses with her youngest son Sean (Mitchell Anderson), and his fiance Tiffany (Mary Smith), arrangements for the Christmas season. Now working as a police deputy in Amity, Sean is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked by a shark. He is killed as his screams are drowned out by the carol singers on the island.
Ellen is convinced that the shark had deliberately targeted Sean due to some evil curse, and visits her eldest son, Michael (Lance Guest), in the Bahamas. Michael now works as a marine biologist. Fearing he will be attacked next by the shark, Ellen hopes to convince him to take up a new job on dry land. She meets Hoagie (Michael Caine), and they begin dating. Michael's wife Carla (Karen Young) is an artist and one day during her art exhibit, Ellen's granddaughter Thea (Judith Barsi) asks if she can go out on a banana boat with her friend Margaret and her mother (Diane Hetfield). The shark attacks the boat with Thea on it. The shark ends up devouring Margaret's mother in the process with blood flying everywhere, leaving Thea unharmed, but in a state of shock. Ellen becomes convinced that the shark has tracked her family to the Bahamas. She takes a boat out to sea on her own, intent on confronting and killing the shark to break the curse, or sacrificing herself hoping the shark will leave her family alone.


The shark leaps out of the water to attack Jake (Mario Van Peebles)
Hoagie flies Michael and his friend Jake (Mario Van Peebles) out to sea so that they can find Ellen quickly. Hoagie lands the plane on the sea, but the shark sinks it. Looking out for the shark while using a device that emits electromagnetic impulses to drive the shark mad, Jake moves to the end of the prow. The shark unexpectedly leaps from the surface of the water to grab Jake, biting into him and dragging him beneath the surface in a gory fashion. The device causes the shark to repeatedly leap out of the water and Ellen steers the boat directly for the shark, impaling it on the broken bowsprit, which somehow causes it to explode. After killing the shark, they find Jake mauled but alive. Near the end of the film, Ellen is relieved that the curse of the shark is no longer on her family. The film ends as Hoagie flies Ellen back to Amity Island.",647992,638,0,323,65.0,1986 October 17

Can love bridge the gap between Earth and Heaven? Moviemakers have thought so for decades. And the pursuit of eternal bliss has never been so sly, engaging or magical as when Timothy Hutton and Kelly McGillis strike up a romance Made in Heaven. Deceased drifter Mike (Hutton) arrives in Heaven and quickly falls for newborn soul Annie (McGillis), soon to start her assignment on Earth. When Annie leaves, Mike follows, risking all to find her in her new identity with neither having memories of their previous celestial existence. Maureen Stapleton, Amanda Plummer and an array of star cameos highlight what director Alan Rudolph (Afterglow, Welcome to L.A.) calls a good old-fashioned fairy tale of destiny and love. Watch and feel like youre on Cloud Nine (Joel Siegel, Good Morning America/ABC-TV).

Directed By Alan Rudolph
Starring Timothy Hutton, Kelly McGillis, Maureen Stapleton

Though the box office was initially meager, the film engendered the good will of critics and has endured as a bonafide cult classic. Stan Winston’s workshop handled the monster makeups and a good behind-the-scenes article can be found here.

Nearly 40 years later, I read the book, finishing it less than an hour ago. Watching this snippet of the film, I now recognise that it is absolutely appalling. Which gives you a flavour of just how magnificent the book is. I highly recommend that you read rather than watch this thing of beauty created by the late J.L. Carr. Thank you Mr. Carr. God bless your beautiful soul."

Scott Valentine (TV's Family Ties) and Michelle Little discover that true love has many faces, and occasionally claws, in the frightfully funny romance My Demon Lover. The happy-go-lucky but lonely Kaz (Valentine) is looking for love when he meets Denny (Little), a cute, kindhearted gal with an uncanny ability to attract stray pets and down-and-out boyfriends. Denny is sure she's met the man of her dreams when she sweeps Kaz off the streets and into her heart. But it's not exactly a match made in heaven because Kaz has a slight problem. Every time he's turned on, he becomes an animal -- literally -- complete with horns...fur...and sometimes a tail! Will Kaz ever be able to shake this curse? And will Denny finally bring out the best, not the beast, in her man? Find out in this monstrously hilarious film!

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
Desmond (Martin Short) is thrilled when the opening number of his musical based on ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" goes off without a hitch.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Ben Foster stars in this teenage comedy as Berke Landers, an average high schooler who has achieved high status by winning over Allison (Melissa Sagemiller), reputed to be the most popular and beautiful girl in his class. After an initially winning time, Allison finds herself drawn to the hot new guy in school, leaving Berke in the lurch. At the risk of ruining his unsteady reputation, Berke concocts a scheme for getting Allison back: he will join the school production of A Midsummer Night's Dream and prove his romanticism to her. Realizing he needs an effective acting coach, he turns to Kelly (Kirsten Dunst), who was once the annoying little sister of a best friend and has suddenly blossomed into a grownup -- to whom Berke finds himself drawn. Berke must then decide if getting Allison back is the ultimate priority, as he falls for the more sensible Kelly, all while trying to maintain a credible presence both in school and in his new acting gig. Get Over It also features R&B singer Sisqo, comedian Martin Short, and Shane West in supporting roles.

2444,"Visit, The (2000)","When Alex is sent to prison for a vicious crime he swears he didn't commit, his family - at the insistence of their brutally strict father - abandon the boy to his fate. Behind bars for what could be a life sentence, Alex subjects himself to a solitary existence, his spirit crushed by the cramped prison cell. A terrible tension tightens every muscle in his body with a frustration equaled only by his father's rage. Both are ready to explode. There's one way out of prison for Alex, and that's in the hands of the parole board. But there is a way out of his self-imposed solitary with the help of a young woman he thought he'd never see again. It's something to live for. Something to die for.

2445,Lilies (1996),"* Winner of the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture (aka the Canadian Oscars) 

One of the most successful gay indie films of the '90s, Lilies won four Canadian Genie Awards® (the equivalent of the American Oscars®) including Best Picture, and won critical acclaim worldwide. 

John Greyson's Lilies is an emotionally intense, suspense-laden tale of love, betrayal and revenge in which one man's past comes back to haunt him and another man's past comes to bring him freedom.

In 1952, Catholic Bishop Bilodeau (Marcel Sabourin, Sum of All Fears) makes an exceptional in-person visit to a prison to hear a dying inmate's last confession. Once in the confessional, the Bishop is confronted by his childhood friend, Simon (Aubert Pallascio, 3 Needles), who collaborates with his fellow inmates to take the Bishop hostage and re-enact Simon's version of the events that led to his murder conviction forty years earlier, in their rural village, of young Vallier.

This flashback story centers on two boys who are madly in love with each other. Young Simon (Jason Cadieux) and Vallier (Danny Gilmore) are cast in a school play about Caesar meeting St. Sebastian. And young Bilodeau, a closeted man secretly in love with Vallier, tries to be close to his love but sees Simon as an obstacle. The action moves back and forth, seamlessly through time, between the crude prison and the actual events of 1912, culminating in the tragic night when both men's fates are decided and their true love is lost forever.

More’s the pity because Wise’s film, about a machinist’s mate caught up in the Chinese civil war of 1926, is an ambitious attempt to examine both political and personal conflicts against an intriguing historical backdrop. Steve McQueen stars as the rebellious sailor alongside Richard Attenborough whose romance with a Chinese courtesan comes to a tragic end.

Back home, Henry confronts his unrequited passion for his high school best friend and his feelings about being gay in a small town. But, as we quickly learn, Big Eden residents defy the stereotype of ""small town, small minds."" 

As Henry works through his emotions, the townspeople quietly conspire to help him along, until Henry realizes new possibilities for both friendship and romance.

Mockumentary directed by Costa Botes & Peter Jackson. Forgotten Silver purports to tell the story of 'forgotten' New Zealand filmmaker Colin McKenzie, and the rediscovery of his lost films, which presenter Peter Jackson claims to have found in an old shed. McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and color film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a 'computer enhancement' of a McKenzie film providing clear evidence that New Zealander Richard Pearse was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months prior to the Wright Brothers.
The film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton. It features deadpan commentary from actor/director Sam Neill and director and film archivist John O'Shea, as well as critical praise from international industry notables including film historian Leonard Maltin, and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films.",41799,101,0,12,61.0,I love the spelling mistake in the titles ..starts the film off on the right foot...how can we get a copy of this &#39;masterpiece&#39; of early cinema ?

mit Götz Gorge, Christian Redl, Jeanette Hain, Felix Eitner u.a.

Der großspurige, aber liebenswerte Zobel (Götz George), sein Lebenspartner Karl (Christian Redl) und Zobels Tochter Lizzi (Jeanette Hain) haben als Taschenräuber-Trio die besten Tage hinter sich. In ihrem klapprigen Wohnmobil fahren sie von Stadt zu Stadt, klauen und werden beklaut, streiten sich und wollen nicht wahrhaben, dass es so nicht weiter geht. 

Als Karl durch einen Verkehrsunfall ausfällt, tritt der junge, naive Rudolf in das Leben von Vater und Tochter -- und macht beiden schöne Augen. Verwicklungen, Konflikte und Enttäuschungen sind vorprogrammiert -- oder gibt es doch ein Happy-End für das Trio?

Für viele überraschend, besetzte Erfolgsregisseurin Hermine Huntgeburth die Rolle des schwulen Kleinganoven Zobel mit „Deutschlands Lieblings-Macho"" (Berliner Zeitung) Götz George. Mit ihm schuf sie, noch überraschender, eine völlig klischeefreie, bührende, originell erzählte Tragikkomödie über Menschen, die mit Charme, Herz und trockenem Witz ihr Leben am Rande der Gesellschaft meistern. Mittlerweile ist DAS TRIO ein Klassiker unter den deutschen Komödien der 1990er Jahre.

2512,Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001),"http://hanumanfilms.com/

Tomb Raider was the first major Hollywood film to shoot in Cambodia since Peter O'Toole starred in Lord Jim in 1964. The Tomb Raider crew were all set to travel to China to film the Terracotta Army coming to life, when the sequence was pulled at the last minute, as it had already been featured in a Chinese movie. Cambodia was next on the list and Hanuman Films was chosen for scouting at Angkor. Following a successful scout with a full technical crew, Paramount British Pictures appointed Hanuman Films as their local servicing partner in the Kingdom of Cambodia.
  
Kulikar Sotho worked as Local Liason Manager, essentially Line Producer, arranging all filming permissions, script approval, temporary import/re-export of equipment, visas, accommodation, transport and catering for the production. Nick Ray worked as Location Manager on the film, selecting locations for the shoot, building a photographic inventory of the temples used in shooting, approving all sets or alterations to be made at each site and working with local authorities every step of the way to ensure this first sensitive shoot at Angkor passed without incident.
  
Hanuman Films also took responsibility for recruitment of extras, recruitment of site security, recruitment of humpers and labourers and recruitment of a large team of interpreters (some turned out to be more like interrupters, but most acquitted themselves well!). 

Tomb Raider premiered on June 15th 2001 at Mann's Theatre in Los Angeles. Nick and Kulikar were both invited to the premiere and stayed with Producer Lloyd Levin for a long weekend of partying.

2516,Let It Snow (1999),"""Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"", also known as ""Let It Snow"", is a song written by lyricist Sammy Cahn and composer Jule Styne in 1945. It was written in July 1945 in Hollywood, California during one of the hottest days on record.  First recorded by Vaughn Monroe, it became a popular hit, reaching number one on the Billboard music chart the following year.  Due to its seasonal lyrics, it is commonly regarded as a Christmas song. Yet despite its cheery, holiday feel, it is a love song that never mentions Christmas.

Oh the weather outside is frightful
 But the fire is so delightful
 And since we've no place to go
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 It doesn't show signs of stopping
 And I've bought some corn for popping
 The lights are turned way down low
 Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

 When we finally kiss good night
 How I'll hate going out in the storm!
 But if you'll really hold me tight
 All the way home I'll be warm

 The fire is slowly dying
 And, my dear, we're still goodbying

Ben Kingsley’s spittle-flecked performance as the bloodthirsty sociopath Don Logan was based, in Kingsley’s own words, on his grandmother, who he described as a “vile and extremely unpleasant woman”.

At first this works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend.

The movie’s eclectic soundtrack, a Demme trademark, reinforces the film’s roller coaster mood swings.

2539,X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963),"X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes is a 1963 science fiction/horror film. Directed by Roger Corman from a script by Ray Russell and Robert Dillon, the film stars Ray Milland as Dr. James Xavier. A world renowned scientist, Dr. Xavier experiments with X-ray vision and things go horribly wrong. While most of the cast are relatively unknown, Don Rickles is notable in an uncharacteristically dramatic role. Veteran character actor Morris Ankrum makes an uncredited appearance, his last in the movie industry.

Shot in a mere three weeks on an ultra-slim budget of $300,000, Corman described the film's success as a miracle. The movie was notable for its use of visual effects to portray Dr. Xavier's point of view. While crude by later standards, the visuals are still effective in impressing upon the audience the bizarre viewpoint of the protagonist.

Vom deutschen Erfolgsteam Bernd Eichinger (Produktion) und Uli Edel (Regie), farblich restauriert und erstmals auf Video-on-Demand.

Die 13-jährige Christiane F. lebt zusammen mit ihrer Mutter und Schwester in einer trostlosen Hochhaussiedlung in Berlin-Gropiusstadt. Um wenigstens zeitweilig den Familienproblemen zu entkommen raucht sie Hasch und wirft Trips. Doch dann steigt sie auf harte Drogen um und nimmt Heroin. Sie wird süchtig. Morgens geht sie in die Schule und nachmittags auf den Kinderstrich am Bahnhof Zoo, um sich das Geld für ihre Sucht zu beschaffen. Immer weiter gerät Christiane in den Sog aus Drogen und Prostitution. Und statt der vermeintlichen Freiheit bringt der Stoff nur Verfall und Tod, der auch einige ihrer engsten Freunde nicht verschont 

""Die 13-jährige Christiane F. lebt in Berlin und erlebt die soziale Misere der Familie, aus der sie wenigstens zeitweilig mit Tabletten entkommen will. Sie wird süchtig. In der Schule wird sie durch ihre Clique im Konsum bestärkt. Bald steigt sie auf harte Drogen um und nimmt Heroin. Obwohl sie ihren Freund Detlef liebt, mit ihm ein Konzert von David Bowie besucht, wird sie zur Prostituierten und steht vor dem endgültigen Abstieg. Sie versucht, von der Droge loszukommen, was ihr nach etlichen vergeblichen Anläufen gelingt.

""Christiane F."" war einer der deutschen Kinoerfolge der achtziger Jahre und Bernd Eichingers Durchbruch als Produzent. Der Stoff basiert auf Tonbandprotokollen der 15-jährigen Christiane, die den ""Stern""-Reportern Kai Hermann und Horst Rieck ihre Geschichte vortrug und die Verfilmungsrechte zusammen mit ihnen an Eichinger verkaufte. Das Problem des Drogenmissbrauchs wird in der Genauigkeit der Beobachtungen im schmutzigen Milieu deutlich, das Lebensgefühl der Abhängigen authentisch eingefangen."" (www.video.de)

Michael J. Fox is electrifying in a powerful tale of excess and redemption from bestselling author Jay McInerney and Oscar® winning producer Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa). Jamie Conway (Fox, Back To The Future) is an aspiring writer who leaves his home town in Kansas for the dynamic cityscape of Manhattan in an attempt to fuel his career and inform his writing experience. But the seductive side of life gets under his skin. The party culture enlivens his nights with hedonistic joy as he surfs a wave of excess that deadens his pain and wires his senses. In his charge to live life to the absolute limit, Jamie alienates his friends and family and risks losing everything.

Lange is his sweetheart, willingly led to life's sidelines as a player's wife, but eventually becoming a woman of strength. And Hutton is the friend who sees what living in a goldfish bowl does to supposedly charmed lives. Director Taylor Hackford (An Officer and a Gentleman, Proof of Life) guides his stellar talents through a spellbinding 30-year saga of our lives without fumbling a single detail.

Ex-Marine Ellie and shy bookworm Janis are fledgling female Feds who'd make Eliot Ness proud. More importantly, they'll make you laugh. Starring as these plucky FBI recruits are gangbuster comediennes Rebecca de Mornay (Risky Business, Wedding Crashers) and Mary Gross (Saturday Night Live, A Mighty Wind). ""Brawny"" Ellie and ""brainy"" Janis go together like ham and eggs, and their lives will be hilariously scrambled during their hilarious, hectic training. Janis must learn physicality and intimidation techniques, while Ellie needs a guiding hand to help get through the intricacies of constitutional law. So in true buddy fashion, they'll help each other prepare for the academy's final exam: a ""simulated crime exercise"" that chauvinistic lunkheads think will separate the men from the girls.

Directed By Daniel Goldberg

The Milagro Beanfield War Trailer - Directed by Robert Redford and starring RubÉn Blades, Richard Bradford, James Gammon, John Heard, Carlos Riquelme. In Milagro, a small town in the American Southwest, Ladd Devine plans to build a major new resort development. While activist Ruby Archuleta and lawyer/newspaper editor Charlie Bloom realize that this will result in the eventual displacement of the local Hispanic farmers, they cannot arouse much opposition because of the short term opportunities offered by construction jobs.

2603,Moon Over Parador (1988),"Moon over Parador is a (1988) romantic comedy film, starring Richard Dreyfuss, Raul Julia and Sonia Braga. It is a remake of the 1939 film The Magnificent Fraud, based on the unpublished short story entitled ""Caviare for His Excellency"" by Charles G. Booth.

The film follows the exploits of Jack Noah (Dreyfuss), who is filming in the small, fictional South American country of Parador when the Paradorian president-for-life suddenly dies of a heart attack. Not wanting to lose his position in power, the president's right-hand man, Roberto Strausmann (Raul Julia) forces Jack to take the 'role of a lifetime' - that of the dead president, as the two men look so much alike. Jack accepts, eventually winning over the people and even the dead president's mistress, Madonna (Sonia Braga). However, when paradise proves to be too boring, Jack needs to find a way to get out while keeping Roberto out of the loop.

After his father is killed in a tragic accident, young Jim Craig (Tom Burlinson) has to leave the mountains, where he has grown up, to look for work. He makes the acquaintance of grizzled prospector Spur, and Spur's more respectable brother Harrison (both played by Hollywood legend Kirk Douglas -- Spartacus). When Jim falls for Harrison's daughter, however, the old man doesn't approve. But Jim is in love and won't be deterred. He will prove his worth, no matter what the challenge!

Adapted from the epic poem by 'Banjo' Patterson (Waltzing Mathilda), and filmed on stunning locations, The Man From Snowy River isn't just a glorious Australian classic: it's one of the finest family films ever made.

2660,Penn & Teller Get Killed (1989),"Penn & Teller Get Killed (1989) #WarnerArchive #WarnerBros #PennAndTellerGetKilled

The ""bad boys of magic"" go over the edge in this mind-blowing, role-switching comedy murder mystery set in the dizzying world of Altlantic City casinos. In a TV interview, Penn mentions his idea of a fun practical joke: ""I wish someone were trying to kill me. It would give focus to my life, excitement. I'd be like James Bond."" Twenty-million people hear him. One decides to deliver a punchline he'll never forget. Made by people who thought Psycho was a comedy, Penn & Teller Get Killed (they also wrote the piece) features Caitlin Clarke as the femme fatale and David Patrick Kelly as the Edgar Allan Poe-esque nutcase with a new mission. Arthur Penn, known for hip masterpieces like Bonnie and Clyde, Alice's Restaurant and Little Big Man, directs with roller-coaster pacing and subversive intelligence.

Directed By Arthur Penn
Starring Penn Jillette, Teller, Caitlin Clarke

The Hotel New Hampshire Trailer - Directed by Tony Richardson and starring Rob Lowe, Paul McCrane, Beau Bridges, Seth Green, Wally Aspell. John Irving's picaresque black comedy about an eccentric and unusually peripatetic family in a film starring Rob Lowe as John Berry, the family's oldest son. John's father, Win (Beau Bridges), is obsessed with hotels, so he buys a run-down seminary in New England, transforming it into the Hotel New Hampshire. The extended family includes the profanity-spouting Franny (Jodie Foster); Lily (Jennifer Dundas); a dwarf, Frank (Paul McCrane), who is gay; John, who is strongly attracted to his sister; Egg (Seth Green), the youngest boy; and Iowa Bob (Wilford Brimley), Win's father. After a number of tragic incidents, including the gang rape of Franny, are seen through the special lenses of black comedy, the family is invited to take over another hotel in Vienna, courtesy of their friend Freud (Wallace Shawn). Richardson elicits fine performances from his talented cast in this wild ride through the mind of John Irving.

2713,Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001),"Tratto da un libro e una storia vera.
Film dedicato ai caduti Italiani e Greci in Cefalonia durante la guerra.
L'isola di Cefalonia subisce l'invasione dell'esercito italiano tra cui c'è il Capitano Antonio Corelli che s'innamora della bellissima Pelagia, figlia del medico del villaggio. La guerra si avvicina e Antonio e Pelagia devono scegliere tra la fedeltà ai loro rispettivi paesi ed il loro amore, per il quale dovranno affrontare enormi difficoltà e inevitabili sacrifici prima di giurarsi eterna devozione.
Captain Corelli's Mandolin is a 2001 film directed by John Madden and based on the novel of the same name by Louis de Bernières. It stars Nicolas Cage and Penélope Cruz. The film was panned by critics on its release and disappointed fans by deviating somewhat from the plot of the novel, with many of the book's tragic episodes softened.
The main characters are Antonio Corelli, an Italian captain, and Pelagia, the daughter of the local physician, Dr. Iannis. An important event in the novel is the massacre of Italian troops by the Germans in September 1943.The idyllic beauty of Greece's Mediterranean islands has been invaded by Italy, bringing legions of soldiers to the once tranquil island of Cephallonia. Captain Antonio Corelli, an officer with an irrepressibly jovial personality and passion for the mandolin, initially alienates a number of the villagers, including Pelagia. The daughter of the village doctor, Pelagia is an educated and strong-willed woman, and while at first offended by the Italian soldier's behaviour, she slowly warms to his certain charms as they are forced to share her father's home.
When Pelagia's fiance, a local fisherman, heads off to war, the friendship between Antonio and Pelagia grows even stronger. Her beauty and intelligence have captured his heart and his fondness for the village's vibrant community causes him to question his reasons for fighting. Antonio becomes a part of the lives of the villagers, but the moment is fleeting. As the war grows ever closer, Antonio and Pelagia are forced to choose between their allegiance to their countries and the love they feel for one another-a love which must overcome tremendous odds, and endure the inevitable sacrifice which accompanies eternal devotion.

Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact, traveling back in time to avoid prosecution for his sister's death, and to find Ruby, whose photo he saw back home. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?

The story goes that the murder was an act of vengeance, after his wife filed for divorce, with DePue shooting her in the back of the head.<br><br>In Jeepers Creepers, the monster dumps bodies behind an abandoned church, much the same way DePue disposed of his wife, but it wasn’t DePue that inspired the film so much as it was the testimony of two eyewitnesses who saw him dump the body.<br>While driving around on a long stretch of Michigan road, Ray and Marie Thornton spotted DePue doing his dirty deed, and then found themselves followed by the killer, who suspiciously tailed them in his van for several miles. Sound familiar? Because it certainly should, if you’ve seen Jeepers Creepers.<br><br>Now what’s most interesting about all of this is that the TV show “Unsolved Mysteries” ran a story on the DePue case in March of 1991, a full ten years before Jeepers Creepers was made. The segment featured a re-enactment of Thornton’s story, which bears a striking resemblance to the first half of Salva’s film.<br>The opening sequence of Jeepers Creepers was directly lifted from the episode, right down to specific shots and dialogue exchanges. Like the Thornton’s, the brother and sister in the film even pass the time by playing the very same license plate game, making the inspiration undeniable.<br>Shortly after the 1990 episode of Unsolved Mysteries was aired, real-life ‘Creeper’ Dennis DePue was caught, and subsequently committed suicide."

2725,Speedway Junky (1999),"In this gritty drama executively-produced by Gus Van Sant, a teenage would-be stock-car driver gets more than he bargained for when he makes a pit stop in Las Vegas to earn a little cash. 

Almost as soon as he arrives in the city, high-school dropout Johnny (Jesse Bradford) finds himself victimized at the slot machines by a slick little vixen. 

His journey to glory on the racetrack thus sidetracked, he soon falls in with a group of hoods and street urchins. Befriended by solicitous hustler Steven (Jordan Brower) and condescended to by gay-for-pay stud Eric (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), Johnny gets a quick introduction to the sleazy Vegas landscape. 

At first he rejects his new acquaintances, but after a disastrous liaison with a buxom young lady (Tiffani-Amber Thiessen), he finds himself the reluctant new best friend of the besotted Steven. Adamantly professing his own heterosexuality, Johnny tries to find female clients to bankroll his ticket out of town. But soon Eric arrives, promising big bucks from his wealthy male patrons, setting the stage for conflict with Steven and unexpected bloodshed. 

Shown during the Panorama program at the 1999 International Berlin Film Festival, Speedway Junky was the debut feature from writer/director Nickolas Perry. Daryl Hannah co-stars as an older ex-prostitute who serves as a sort of foster mother for both Johnny and Steven.

2726,Vamp (1986),"Flesh hungry freaks, exotic vampire dancers and black comedy combine in one of the great cult video store hits of the 1980s... Vamp.

At school, getting into the right fraternity can be a matter of life or death. Keith and AJ need to hire a stripper to entertain the brothers or their college days are over. In a shady after hours joint they find an adult entertainer like no other when they step into the world of sharp-fanged Katrina. Have these two freshmen bitten off more than they can chew? Stuck on the wrong side of town, on a dark night and surrounded by a plague of alien blood suckers the answer is definitely yes!

With a cast including the gorgeous Dedee Pfeiffer and the frighteningly beautiful Grace Jones, this oddball combination of blood, laughs and vampire hotness is a must have for all lovers of the undead.

Vamp (cert. 18) will be released on DVD (£17.99) and Blu-ray (£22.99) by Arrow Video on 21st February 2011.",25219,101,0,7,84.0,I could swear this was shown at a grindhouse double feature with Once Bitten.

2740,Sidewalks of New York (2001),"An intricate web of relationships is examined by Ed Burns (THE BROTHERS McMULLEN, SHE'S THE ONE) in SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK. Burns, who also wrote and produced the film, stars as Tommy Reilly, a boy from Queens turned successful Manhattanite. After being kicked out of the apartment he shared with his girlfriend, he is back in the dating scene. When he meets a divorced schoolteacher, the connections between the additional main characters in the ensemble are identified slowly but surely: a divorced couple, an adulterous married man and his mistress, and a doubting wife. Burns' look at relationships leaves no stone unturned as the main characters and their friends discuss their love lives. Filmed throughout New York City, the characters' stories are spliced together by their own personal monologues in documentary-style scenes. Well-delivered, witty, and humorous banter that is reminiscent of the works of Woody Allen keeps the story moving, as does the shooting technique of following behind the characters with the camera. Tucci, in particular, delivers a standout performance as a two-timing, lecherous dentist.

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
A couple experiences love at first sight and leaves it up to destiny to bring them back together again.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
After the long-delayed Town and Country, director Peter Chelsom turns in his second 2001 effort with this love-at-first-sight romantic comedy that revolves around fate, destiny, and chance. Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of ""fate"" games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends (Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven) to help them find their true love again. Serendipity had its Gala World Premiere at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.

2766,Iron Monkey (Siu nin Wong Fei-hung ji: Tit Ma Lau) (1993),"TODAY's upload is a fast paced trailer for Platinum edition DVD release of Hong Kong martial arts adventure - IRON MONKEY.  Trailer is in my oppinion nicely done with fine music background and atmospheric voice narration.  Movie is worth it - especially if you like martial arts movies in wuxia style and watch the Platinum edition that includes many bonuses and infos about HK cinema and cast. This one is really one of HK LEGENDS :-).

Iron Monkey is a 1993 Hong Kong movie by director and martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo Ping (later become widely famous in the west through his Matrix work). Produced by Tsui Hark.

For this breathtaking epic adventure set in late Ching dynasty, acclaimed action director Yuen Woo-ping combines incredible dynamic, high-flying fight-action and stunning cinematography with a classic wuxia story of courage, honour and sacrifice. 

International action superstars Donnie Yen and Yu Rong Kwong give nice performances as two legendary warriors who must put their lives on the line to defeat the barbaric excesses of a corrupt political regime and protect the lives of the people and child who later becomes ""The Legend"" Wong Fei Hong. 

The DVD with many nice bonuses in this Platinum edition is worth seeing. Movie is not as ambitious as ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA, including some comedy sequences but avoiding non-sensical sense of humour. Despite its qualities, Iron Monkey was unfortunately a flop at the HK box office.

From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray, a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers she's pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverly's marriage begins to fall apart. Ray tries to do the right thing but has trouble holding a job, and becomes addicted to heroin.",612115,1093,0,203,150.0,I think the kid Beverly was a more charming actress than drew barrymore.

_________________________________________________________________
Burnt Money, is set in Argentina in 1965. This true story follows the tumultuous relationship between two men who became lovers and ultimately ruthless bank robbers in a notoriously famous footnote in the annals of Argentinian crime history. Nene, Angel and Cuervo are bank robbers who flee from Argentina across the border to Uruguay after a large-scale hold-up that turns bloody. Angel is hurt and the three must lay low until Angel recovers. Nene and Angel are known to everyone they know as ""the twins"" because of their resemblance, but the two are not brothers at all - they are involved in a steamy homosexual relationship. To get back to Argentina, the group must first wait for Fontana, the brains behind the robbery, to arrange for passports. Anxious from hiding, Cuervo decides to break curfew and go party. After Nene and Angel also decide to take off, Nene meets a prostitute named Giselle and Angel ends up getting in a fight...",142985,354,0,15,168.0,"Pellicola molto bella ispirata in modo romanzato alla storia vera di una famigerata rapina in banca del 1965 a Bene Aires e della successiva fuga dei rapinatori verso la vicina Montevideo, certo nulla di eccezionale ma comunque interessante, quindi molto bella e molto bella per me come valutazione è 7,5."

2794,Hell Up in Harlem (1973),"This hastily assembled sequel to the blaxploitation hit Black Caesar downplays the gritty drama of that film to create a pure action tale with a comic book flavor. The story begins with badly wounded crimelord Tommy Gibbs (Fred Williamson) escaping an assassination attempt masterminded by corrupt District Attorney DiAngelo (Gerald Gordon) with the help of his estranged father, Papa Gibbs (Julius Harris). When DiAngelo's thugs attempt to kill him, Papa fights back and joins his son's criminal organization, a move that angers Gibb's top henchman Zach (Tony King). As Tommy and Papa build up their criminal empire, Zach secretly plots against them with DiAngelo. Zach also murders Helen (Gloria Hendry), Tommy's traitorous ex-wife, and pins in it on Papa to drive a wedge between them. Tommy gives up his New York crime operation and runs off to California. Papa takes over the operation, only to get killed by Zach during a fistfight. Angered by his father's death, Tommy returns to settle the score with Zach and DiAngelo. Hell up in Harlem delivers plenty of action set pieces and did fairly well at the box office, but lacks the consistency and the dramatic punch that made Black Caesar so memorable. As a result, it is considered to be one of Larry Cohen's lesser efforts. ~ Donald Guarisco, All Movie Guide",70920,282,0,24,129.0,Margaret Avery got her freak on with Fred Williamson

CLIP DESCRIPTION:
In a small village in the Shire a young Hobbit named Frodo (Elijah Wood) has been entrusted with an ancient Ring. Now he must embark on an epic quest to the Cracks of Doom in order to destroy it.

FILM DESCRIPTION:
New Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson fulfills his lifelong dream of transforming author J.R.R. Tolkien's best-selling fantasy epic into a three-part motion picture that begins with this holiday 2001 release. Elijah Wood stars as Frodo Baggins, a Hobbit resident of the medieval ""Middle-earth"" who discovers that a ring bequeathed to him by beloved relative and benefactor Bilbo (Ian Holm) is in fact the ""One Ring,"" a device that will allow its master to manipulate dark powers and enslave the world. Frodo is charged by the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to return the ring to Mount Doom, the evil site where it was forged millennia ago and the only place where it can be destroyed. Accompanying Frodo is a fellowship of eight others: his Hobbit friends Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), and Pippin (Billy Boyd); plus Gandalf; the human warriors Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean); Elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom); and Dwarf soldier Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). The band's odyssey to the dreaded land of Mordor, where Mount Doom lies, takes them through the Elfish domain of Rivendell and the forest of Lothlorien, where they receive aid and comfort from the Elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler), her father, Elrond (Hugo Weaving), and Queen Galadriel (Cate Blanchett). In pursuit of the travelers and their ring are Saruman (Christopher Lee) -- a traitorous wizard and kin, of sorts, to Gandalf -- and the Dark Riders, under the control of the evil, mysterious Sauron (Sala Baker). The Fellowship must also do battle with a troll, flying spies, Orcs, and other deadly obstacles both natural and otherwise as they draw closer to Mordor. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) was filmed in Jackson's native New Zealand, closely followed by its pair of sequels, The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).

_____________________________________________________________
It's the off-season at the lonely Beauregard Hotel in Bournemoth, and only the long-term tenants are still in residence. Life at the Beauregard is stirred up, however, when the beautiful Ann Shankland arrives to see her alcoholic ex-husband, John Malcolm, who is secretly engaged to Pat Cooper, the woman who runs the hotel. Meanwhile, snobbish Mrs Railton-Bell discovers that the kindly if rather doddering Major Pollock is not what he appears to be. The news is particularly shocking for her frail daughter, Sibyl, who is secretly in love with the Major. (Patrick Sullivan, Imdb)

- Forget What You Think You Know
- The Champ is here!

Will Smith spent approximately one year learning all aspects of Ali's life. These included boxing training, Islamic studies and dialect training (to help him speak like Ali). Smith has said that his portrayal of Ali is his proudest work to date.

One of the selling points of the film is the realism of the fight scenes. All of the boxers in the film are in fact former or current world heavyweight champions. It was quickly decided that 'Hollywood fighting' - passing the fist (or foot) between the camera and the face to create the illusion of a hit - would not be used in favor of actual boxing. The only limitation placed upon the fighters was for Charles Shufford (who plays George Foreman). He was permitted to hit Will Smith as hard as he could, so long as he did not actually knock the actor out.

Muhammad Ali from 1964 to 1974, told in three braided threads. The boxer: from becoming champion to regaining the championship. Religion and politics: Cassius Clay becomes a Black Muslim, truncates a friendship with Malcolm X, perhaps is Elijah Muhammad's pawn, refuses induction into the US military, and faces a five year prison sentence while his case goes to the Supreme Court. Family: he marries twice and by 1974 marriage two is strained, defends his white trainer, has a brother in Bundini Brown, and is wily with Howard Cosell. Throughout, Ali keeps his own counsel: in the ring, at the induction center when he won't step forward, and in friendship, love, and victory.

In 1964, a brash new pro boxer, fresh from his olympic gold medal victory, explodes on to the scene, Cassius Clay. Bold and outspoken, he cuts an entirely new image for African American's in sport with his proud public self confidence with his unapologetic belief that he is the greatest boxer of all time. To his credit, he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam, his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favour of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy. Yet, at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test with the military draft rules are changed, making him eligible for military induction during the Vietnam War. Despite the fact that he could easily agree to a sweetheart deal that would have meant an easy tour of duty for himself, Ali refuses to submit on principle to cooperate in an unjust war for a racist nation that treated his people so poorly. The cost of that stand is high as he finds himself unable to legally box in his own country while his case is contested in court. What follows is a battle for a man who would sacrifice so much for what he believes in and a comeback that would cement his legend as one of the great sports figures of all time.

Smith had to gain a significant amount of weight to look the part of Muhammad Ali. His current physique is due to the weight gains he had to make for Ali.

The first of Pinter's three film collaborations with Losey, which also include Accident (1967) and The Go-Between (1970), The Servant is a tightly-constructed psychological dramatic film about the relationships among the four central characters examining issues relating to class, servitude, and the ennui of the upper classes",68516,187,0,16,176.0,Incredible performance by dirk and the enrtire cast a masterpiece  Joseph loser was a terribly underrated director
2867,Come Undone (Presque Rien) (2000),"'Presque Rien' ('Come Undone') is an earlier work by the inordinately gifted writer/ director Sébastien Lifshitz (with the collaboration of writer Stéphane Bouquet - the team that gave us the later 'Wild Side'). As we come to understand Lifshitz's manner of storytelling each of his works becomes more treasureable. By allowing his tender and sensitive love stories to unfold in the same random fashion found in the minds of confused and insecure youths - time now, time passed, time reflective, time imagined, time alone - Lifshitz makes his tales more personal, involving the viewer with every aspect of the characters' responses. It takes a bit of work to key into his method, but going with his technique draws us deeply into the film.

Mathieu (handsome and gifted Jérémie Elkaïm) is visiting the seaside for a holiday, a time to allow his mother (Dominique Reymond) to struggle with her undefined illness, cared for by the worldly and wise Annick (Marie Matheron) and accompanied by his sister Sarah (Laetitia Legrix): their distant father has remained at home for business reasons. Weaving in and out of the first moments of the film are images of Mathieu alone, looking depressed, riding trains, speaking to someone in a little recorder. We are left to wonder whether the unfolding action is all memory or contemporary action.

While sunning at the beach Mathieu notices a handsome youth his age starring at him, and we can feel Mathieu's emotions quivering with confusion. The youth Cédric (Stéphane Rideau) follows Mathieu and his sister home, continuing the mystery of attraction. Soon Cédric approaches Mathieu and a gentle introduction leads to a kiss that begins a passionate love obsession. Mathieu is terrified of the direction he is taking, rebuffs Cédric's public approaches, but continues to seek him out for consignations. The two young men are fully in the throes of being in love and the enactment of the physical aspect of this relationship, so very necessary to understanding this story, is shared with the audience in some very erotic and sensual scenes. Yet as the summer wears on Mathieu, a committed student, realizes that Cédric is a drifter working in a condiment stand at a carnival. It becomes apparent that Cédric is the Dionysian partner while Mathieu is the Apollonian one: in a telling time in architectural ruin Mathieu is excited by the beauty of the history and space while Cédric is only interested in the place as a new hideaway for lovemaking.

Mathieu is a complex person, coping with his familial ties strained by critical illness and a non-present father, a fear of his burgeoning sexuality, and his nascent passion for Cédric. Their moments of joy are disrupted by Cédric's admission of infidelity and Mathieu's inability to cope with that issue and eventually they part ways. Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression including a suicide attempt. The manner in which Mathieu copes with all of these challenges and finds solace, strangely enough, in one of Cédric's past lovers Pierre (Nils Ohlund) brings the film to an ambiguous yet wholly successful climax.

After viewing the film the feeling of identification with these characters is so strong that the desire to start the film from the beginning now with the knowledge of the complete story is powerful. Lifshitz has given us a film of meditation with passion, conflicts with passion's powers found in love, and a quiet film of silences and reveries that are incomparably beautiful. The entire cast is superb and the direction is gentle and provocative. Lifshitz is most assuredly one of the bright lights of film-making. In French with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

His little nephew Minh (Trung Nguyen) and niece Anh (Jennifer Tran) are anxiously awaiting the arrival of their mother, who was left behind during the evacuation. Fortunately, Minh finds a friend in the camp cook (Forest Whitaker), and together they paint a colorful mural on the kitchen wall. Meanwhile, another refugee, Duc (Billinjer Tran), tries hard to embrace the American way of life, but finds heartbreak when he discovers his lost love (Kathleen Luong) is also at the camp, now the second wife of another man. Time passes and everyone listens to the fall of Saigon over the radio while waiting to be assimilated, like it or not, into their strange new homeland. Directed by Timothy Linh Bui, this is a stately, mournful series of vignettes that brings healing attention to an aspect of the Vietnam War some may have forgotten.

From the South Bronx in the 1970's to San Francisco now, the world's best scratchers, beat-diggers, party-rockers, and producers wax poetic on beats, breaks, battles, and the infinite possibilities of vinyl.

Scratch starts with an origin story. Grand Wizard Theodore (the ""Thomas Edison of the movement"") recalls the day, way back in 1975, when his grandmother told him to turn down the music he was making in front of his Bronx River Houses apartment. In order to hear her, he put his hand on the turntable, holding the record in place. As he moved his hand, slightly, a new sound rose up. And so, he smiles, scratching was born.

2927,"Bad News Bears, The (1976)","Michael Ritchie’s 1976 comedy about a squad of underachieving Little Leaguers and their boozing coach (played by a rumpled Walter Matthau) is a bracing antidote to most of today’s carefully vetted family-friendly feel good films. Ritchie’s uniquely warmhearted but unsentimental take on his crew of misfits allows even the most peripheral of characters their own memorable moments. Rowdy, profane and, happily, avoiding the cheap theatrics of the triumphant finale usually found in sports films, The Bad News Bears is yet another wonderfully unruly example of the lost, lamented 70s cinema. Forty years later, The Daily News chats with cast and crew on  the  anniversary of Ritchie’s film.

Brit Clive Donner may have seemed an odd choice to direct, but in all probability nobody else would have been able to impose much personality on this generic Universal Studios project, which plays out pretty much like a TV movie despite the strenuous efforts of star Don Adams and some occasionally funny supporting players. Fans of the show still like this one, though.
